        "abstract": "This report documents the development, test, and application of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) for automated text analysis, with a specific focus on\ngambling-like elements in digital games, such as lootboxes. The project aimed\nnot only to analyse user opinions and attitudes towards these mechanics, but\nalso to advance methodological research in text analysis. By employing\nprompting techniques and iterative prompt refinement processes, the study\nsought to test and improve the accuracy of LLM-based text analysis. The\nfindings indicate that while LLMs can effectively identify relevant patterns\nand themes on par with human coders, there are still challenges in handling\nmore complex tasks, underscoring the need for ongoing refinement in\nmethodologies. The methodological advancements achieved through this study\nsignificantly enhance the application of LLMs in real-world text analysis. The\nresearch provides valuable insights into how these models can be better\nutilized to analyze complex, user-generated content.",

        "abstract": "Human cultural complexity did not arise in a vacuum. Scholars in the\nhumanities and social sciences have long debated how ecological factors, such\nas climate and resource availability, enabled early hunter-gatherers to\nallocate time and energy beyond basic subsistence tasks. This paper presents a\nformal, interdisciplinary approach that integrates theoretical modeling with\ncomputational methods to examine whether conditions that allow lower spoilage\nof stored food, often associated with colder climates and abundant large fauna,\ncould indirectly foster the emergence of cultural complexity. Our contribution\nis twofold. First, we propose a mathematical framework that relates spoilage\nrates, yield levels, resource management skills, and cultural activities. Under\nthis framework, we prove that lower spoilage and adequate yields reduce the\nfrequency of hunting, thus freeing substantial time for cultural pursuits.\nSecond, we implement a reinforcement learning simulation, inspired by\nengineering optimization techniques, to validate the theoretical predictions.\nBy training agents in different $(Y,p)$ environments, where $Y$ is yield and\n$p$ is the probability of daily spoilage, we observe patterns consistent with\nthe theoretical model: stable conditions with lower spoilage strongly correlate\nwith increased cultural complexity. While we do not claim to replicate\nprehistoric social realities directly, our results suggest that ecologically\nstable niches provided a milieu in which cultural forms could germinate and\nevolve. This study, therefore, offers an integrative perspective that unites\nhumanistic inquiries into the origins of culture with the formal rigor and\nexploratory power of computational modeling.",

The interactions and complexity of the coupled human-Earth\nsystems make GCAM simulations costly to run at scale - a requirement for large\nensemble experiments which explore uncertainty in model parameters and outputs.\nA differentiable emulator with similar predictive power, but greater\nefficiency, could provide novel scenario discovery and analysis of GCAM and its\noutputs, requiring fewer runs of GCAM. As a first use case, we train a neural\nnetwork on an existing large ensemble that explores a range of GCAM inputs\nrelated to different relative contributions of energy production sources, with\na focus on wind and solar. We complement this existing ensemble with\ninterpolated input values and a wider selection of outputs, predicting 22,528\nGCAM outputs across time, sectors, and regions.

        "abstract": "Given the vital role that smart meter data could play in handling uncertainty\nin energy markets, data markets have been proposed as a means to enable\nincreased data access. However, most extant literature considers energy markets\nand data markets separately, which ignores the interdependence between them. In\naddition, existing data market frameworks rely on a trusted entity to clear the\nmarket. This paper proposes a joint energy and data market focusing on the\nday-ahead retailer energy procurement problem with uncertain demand. The\nretailer can purchase differentially-private smart meter data from consumers to\nreduce uncertainty. The problem is modelled as an integrated forecasting and\noptimisation problem providing a means of valuing data directly rather than\nvaluing forecasts or forecast accuracy. Value is determined by the Wasserstein\ndistance, enabling privacy to be preserved during the valuation and procurement\nprocess. The value of joint energy and data clearing is highlighted through\nnumerical case studies using both synthetic and real smart meter data.",

        "abstract": "As an emerging emitter poised for significant growth in space cooling demand,\nIndia requires comprehensive insights into historical emission trends and\ndecarbonization performance to shape future low-carbon cooling strategies. By\nintegrating a bottom-up demand resource energy analysis model and a top-down\ndecomposition method, this study is the first to conduct a state-level analysis\nof carbon emission trends and the corresponding decarbonization efforts for\nresidential space cooling in urban and rural India from 2000 to 2022. The\nresults indicate that (1) the carbon intensity of residential space cooling in\nIndia increased by 292.4% from 2000 to 2022, reaching 513.8 kilograms of carbon\ndioxide per household. The net state domestic product per capita, representing\nincome, emerged as the primary positive contributor. (2) The increase in carbon\nemissions from space cooling can be primarily attributed to the use of fans.\nWhile fan-based space cooling has nearly saturated Indian urban households, it\nis anticipated to persist as the primary cooling method in rural households for\ndecades. (3) States with higher decarbonization potential are concentrated in\ntwo categories: those with high household income and substantial cooling\nappliance ownership and those with pronounced unmet cooling demand but low\nhousehold income and hot climates. Furthermore, it is believed that promoting\nenergy-efficient building designs can be prioritized to achieve affordable\nspace cooling. Overall, this study serves as an effective foundation for\nformulating and promoting India's future cooling action plan, addressing the\ncountry's rising residential cooling demands and striving toward its net-zero\ngoal by 2070.",

Using an experimental\ndesign that separately varies the number of commercial interruptions per hour\nand the number of ads per commercial interruption, we find that listeners\nprimarily respond to the total number of ads per hour, with a slight preference\nfor more frequent but shorter ad breaks. Lastly, we find that increased ad load\nled to an increase in the number of paid ad-free subscriptions to Pandora.\nImportantly, we show that observational methods often lead to biased or even\ndirectionally incorrect estimates of these effects, highlighting the value of\nexperimental data.",

Existing measures of AI occupational exposure largely\nfocus on AI's theoretical potential to substitute or complement human labour on\nthe basis of technical feasibility, providing limited insight into actual\nadoption and offering inadequate guidance for policymakers. To address this\ngap, we introduce the AI Startup Exposure (AISE) index-a novel metric based on\noccupational descriptions from O*NET and AI applications developed by startups\nfunded by the Y Combinator accelerator. Our findings indicate that while\nhigh-skilled professions are theoretically highly exposed according to\nconventional metrics, they are heterogeneously targeted by startups. Roles\ninvolving routine organizational tasks-such as data analysis and office\nmanagement-display significant exposure, while occupations involving tasks that\nare less amenable to AI automation due to ethical or high-stakes, more than\nfeasibility, considerations -- such as judges or surgeons -- present lower AISE\nscores. By focusing on venture-backed AI applications, our approach offers a\nnuanced perspective on how AI is reshaping the labour market. It challenges the\nconventional assumption that high-skilled jobs uniformly face high AI risks,\nhighlighting instead the role of today's AI players' societal\ndesirability-driven and market-oriented choices as critical determinants of AI\nexposure. Contrary to fears of widespread job displacement, our findings\nsuggest that AI adoption will be gradual and shaped by social factors as much\nas by the technical feasibility of AI applications.

Two apparently unrelated limitations\naffect these algorithms. On one hand, it is not clear what the basic operation\ndefining vector spaces, i.e. the vector sum, corresponds to in terms of the\noriginal nodes in the network. On the other hand, while the same input network\ncan be represented at multiple levels of resolution by coarse-graining the\nconstituent nodes into arbitrary block-nodes, the relationship between node\nembeddings obtained at different hierarchical levels is not understood. Here,\nbuilding on recent results in network renormalization theory, we address these\ntwo limitations at once and define a multiscale node embedding method that,\nupon arbitrary coarse-grainings, ensures statistical consistency of the\nembedding vector of a block-node with the sum of the embedding vectors of its\nconstituent nodes. We illustrate the power of this approach on two economic\nnetworks that can be naturally represented at multiple resolution levels:\nnamely, the international trade between (sets of) countries and the\ninput-output flows among (sets of) industries in the Netherlands. We confirm\nthe statistical consistency between networks retrieved from coarse-grained node\nvectors and networks retrieved from sums of fine-grained node vectors, a result\nthat cannot be achieved by alternative methods. Several key network properties,\nincluding a large number of triangles, are successfully replicated already from\nembeddings of very low dimensionality, allowing for the generation of faithful\nreplicas of the original networks at arbitrary resolution levels.",

        "abstract": "Generative AI is rapidly reshaping creative work, raising critical questions\nabout its beneficiaries and societal implications. This study challenges\nprevailing assumptions by exploring how generative AI interacts with diverse\nforms of human capital in creative tasks. Through two random controlled\nexperiments in flash fiction writing and song composition, we uncover a\nparadox: while AI democratizes access to creative tools, it simultaneously\namplifies cognitive inequalities. Our findings reveal that AI enhances general\nhuman capital (cognitive abilities and education) by facilitating adaptability\nand idea integration but diminishes the value of domain-specific expertise. We\nintroduce a novel theoretical framework that merges human capital theory with\nthe automation-augmentation perspective, offering a nuanced understanding of\nhuman-AI collaboration. This framework elucidates how AI shifts the locus of\ncreative advantage from specialized expertise to broader cognitive\nadaptability. Contrary to the notion of AI as a universal equalizer, our work\nhighlights its potential to exacerbate disparities in skill valuation,\nreshaping workplace hierarchies and redefining the nature of creativity in the\nAI era. These insights advance theories of human capital and automation while\nproviding actionable guidance for organizations navigating AI integration\namidst workforce inequalities.",

We apply SAEs to company descriptions, obtaining\nmeaningful clusters of equities in the process. We benchmark SAE features\nagainst SIC-codes, Major Group codes, and Embeddings. Our results demonstrate\nthat SAE features not only replicate but often surpass sector classifications\nand embeddings in capturing fundamental company characteristics.

Traditional\nmodels like Word2Vec have provided significant insights into long-term semantic\nchanges but often struggle to capture stable meanings in short-term contexts,\nwhich may be attributed to fluctuations in embeddings caused by unbalanced\ntraining data. Recent advancements, particularly BERT (Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers), its pre-trained nature and transformer\nencoder architecture offer contextual embeddings that improve semantic\nconsistency, making it a promising tool for short-term analysis. This study\nempirically compares the performance of Word2Vec and BERT in maintaining stable\nword meanings over time in text analysis tasks relevant to social sciences\nresearch. Using articles from the People's Daily spanning 20 years (2004-2023),\nwe evaluated the semantic stability of each model across different timeframes.\nThe results indicate that BERT consistently outperforms Word2Vec in maintaining\nsemantic stability, offering greater stability in contextual embeddings.\nHowever, the study also acknowledges BERT's limitations in capturing gradual\nsemantic shifts over longer periods due to its inherent stability. The findings\nsuggest that while BERT is advantageous for short-term semantic analysis in\nsocial sciences, researchers should consider complementary approaches for\nlong-term studies to fully capture semantic drift.

In empirical setting, the ML model consistently predicts a negative\nrelationship between demand and price in 100% of cases, whereas the econometric\napproach fails to do so in 20% of cases. The suggested model incorporates a\nwide range of product characteristics, as well as prices of other products and\ncompetitors.",

        "abstract": "An axiomatic approach to macroeconomics based on the mathematical structure\nof thermodynamics is presented. It deduces relations between aggregate\nproperties of an economy, concerning quantities and flows of goods and money,\nprices and the value of money, without any recourse to microeconomic\nfoundations about the preferences and actions of individual economic agents.\nThe approach has three important payoffs. 1) it provides a new and solid\nfoundation for aspects of standard macroeconomic theory such as the existence\nof market prices, the value of money, the meaning of inflation, the symmetry\nand negative-definiteness of the macro-Slutsky matrix, and the Le\nChatelier-Samuelson principle, without relying on implausibly strong\nrationality assumptions over individual microeconomic agents. 2) the approach\ngenerates new results, including implications for money flow and trade when two\nor more economies are put in contact, in terms of new concepts such as economic\nentropy, economic temperature, goods' values and money capacity. Some of these\nare related to standard economic concepts (eg marginal utility of money, market\nprices). Yet our approach derives them at a purely macroeconomic level and\ngives them a meaning independent of usual restrictions. Others of the concepts,\nsuch as economic entropy and temperature, have no direct counterparts in\nstandard economics, but they have important economic interpretations and\nimplications, as aggregate utility and the inverse marginal aggregate utility\nof money, respectively. 3) this analysis promises to open up new frontiers in\nmacroeconomics by building a bridge to ideas from non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics. More broadly, we hope that the economic analogue of entropy\n(governing the possible transitions between states of economic systems) may\nprove to be as fruitful for the social sciences as entropy has been in the\nnatural sciences.",

In\nthis paper, we investigate three widely studied factors in bullwhip\nmeasurement: time aggregation, product aggregation, and seasonality. In time\naggregation, we decompose the variance into two components: the expectation of\nthe subset variances and the variance of subset expectations, thus decomposing\nthe bullwhip ratio into four components to explore the underlying mechanism of\ntime aggregation. In product aggregation, the bullwhip ratio is analyzed in the\ncontext of products with either uncorrelated or correlated demands and orders.\nSeasonality is also examined to study its effect on the bullwhip ratio. Our key\nfindings are: (a) Time aggregation can increase, decrease, or maintain the\nbullwhip ratio in different scenarios. (b) Aggregated bullwhip ratio of\nuncorrelated products is a weighted average of bullwhip ratios from individual\nproducts, with corresponding demand variance as the weights. However,\naggregated bullwhip ratio of correlated products could break the boundaries.\n(c) Seasonality can be considered as a standalone product with a bullwhip ratio\nof one, which can drive the overall bullwhip ratio closer to one.",

This study investigates the properties of global food trade\nconstructed in terms of total food calories associated with all the main food\nproducts exchanged along each trade link (edge of the food trade network).\nUtilizing data from the Food and Agriculture Organization between 1986 and\n2022, we construct a directed, weighted network of net caloric flows between\ncountries. This approach highlights the importance of considering nutritional\nvalue in discussions of food security and trade policies, offering a more\nholistic view of global food trade dynamics. Our analysis reveals significant\nheterogeneity in trade patterns, with certain countries emerging as major\nexporters or importers of food calories.

Building upon the SIRS (Susceptible, Infectious,\nRecovered, Susceptible) epidemiological model, we incorporate a feedback\nmechanism that allows the recovery rate to vary dynamically based on the\ncurrent state of the system.

We find that extreme drought\nevents define long-duration storage operation and investment. The most extreme\nevent in Europe occurred in the winter of 1996/97. Assuming policy-relevant\ninterconnection, long-duration storage of 351 TWh or 7% of yearly electricity\ndemand would be required to deal with this event. As it affects many countries\nsimultaneously, a storage capacity of 159 TWh or 3% of yearly electricity\ndemand remains required even in the extreme case of unconstrained geographical\nbalancing. Before and during Dunkelflaute events, we find complex interactions\nof long-duration storage with other flexibility options. Sensitivity analyses\nillustrate that firm zero-emission generation technologies would only\nmoderately reduce long-duration storage needs. Thus, policymakers and system\nplanners should prepare for a rapid expansion of long-duration storage capacity\nto safeguard the renewable energy transition in Europe. We further argue that\nincluding multiple weather years is required for weather-resilient energy\nsystem modeling, particularly those with pronounced renewable energy droughts.",

Using a general-form repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game, agents\nengage in online learning with no prior model of game structure and no\nknowledge of competitors' states or actions (e.g., no observation of competing\nprices). We show that these context-free bandits, with no knowledge of\nopponents' choices or outcomes, still will consistently learn collusive\nbehavior - what we call \"naive collusion.\" We primarily study this system\nthrough an analytical model and examine perturbations to the model through\nsimulations.\n  Our findings have several notable implications for regulators. First, calls\nto limit algorithms from conditioning on competitors' prices are insufficient\nto prevent algorithmic collusion. This is a direct result of collusion arising\neven in the naive setting. Second, symmetry in algorithms can increase\ncollusion potential. This highlights a new, simple mechanism for\n\"hub-and-spoke\" algorithmic collusion. A central distributor need not imbue its\nalgorithm with supra-competitive tendencies for apparent collusion to arise; it\ncan simply arise by using certain (common) machine learning algorithms.\nFinally, we highlight that collusive outcomes depend starkly on the specific\nalgorithm being used, and we highlight market and algorithmic conditions under\nwhich it will be unknown a priori whether collusion occurs.",

        "abstract": "It is widely assumed that increases in economic productivity necessarily lead\nto economic growth. In this paper, it is shown that this is not always the\ncase. An idealized model of an economy is presented in which a new technology\nallows capital to be utilized autonomously without labor input. This is\nmotivated by the possibility that advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will\ngive rise to AI agents that act autonomously in the economy. The economic model\ninvolves a single profit-maximizing firm which is a monopolist in the product\nmarket and a monopsonist in the labor market. The new automation technology\ncauses the firm to replace labor with capital in such a way that its profit\nincreases while total production decreases. The model is not intended to\ncapture the structure of a real economy, but rather to illustrate how basic\neconomic mechanisms can give rise to counterintuitive and undesirable outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Universal power laws have been scrutinised in physics and beyond, and a\nlong-standing debate exists in econophysics regarding the strict universality\nof the nonlinear price impact, commonly referred to as the square-root law\n(SRL). The SRL posits that the average price impact $I$ follows a power law\nwith respect to transaction volume $Q$, such that $I(Q) \\propto Q^{\\delta}$\nwith $\\delta \\approx 1/2$. Some researchers argue that the exponent $\\delta$\nshould be system-specific, without universality. Conversely, others contend\nthat $\\delta$ should be exactly $1/2$ for all stocks across all countries,\nimplying universality. However, resolving this debate requires high-precision\nmeasurements of $\\delta$ with errors of around $0.1$ across hundreds of stocks,\nwhich has been extremely challenging due to the scarcity of large microscopic\ndatasets -- those that enable tracking the trading behaviour of all individual\naccounts. Here we conclusively support the universality hypothesis of the SRL\nby a complete survey of all trading accounts for all liquid stocks on the Tokyo\nStock Exchange (TSE) over eight years. Using this comprehensive microscopic\ndataset, we show that the exponent $\\delta$ is equal to $1/2$ within\nstatistical errors at both the individual stock level and the individual trader\nlevel. Additionally, we rejected two prominent models supporting the\nnonuniversality hypothesis: the Gabaix-Gopikrishnan-Plerou-Stanley and the\nFarmer-Gerig-Lillo-Waelbroeck models. Our work provides exceptionally\nhigh-precision evidence for the universality hypothesis in social science and\ncould prove useful in evaluating the price impact by large investors -- an\nimportant topic even among practitioners.",

Key findings highlight that,\nwhen harmonized, models produce very similar capacity portfolios under each\ncurrent policies and net-zero configuration, with less than 1 percent\ndifference in system costs for most configurations. This agreement across\nmodels allows us to examine the impact of configuration choices.

Specifically, by\nutilizing procedures for detecting multiple regimes in high-dimensional factor\nmodels, we propose two types of core inflation indicators: one incorporating\nmultiple structural breaks and another based on Markov switching. The\nstructural breaks approach can eliminate revisions for past regimes, though it\nfunctions as an offline indicator, as real-time detection of breaks is not\nfeasible with this method. On the other hand, the Markov switching approach can\nreduce revisions while being useful in real time, making it a simple and robust\ncore inflation indicator suitable for real-time monitoring and as a short-term\nguide for monetary policy. Additionally, this approach allows us to estimate\nthe probability of being in different inflationary regimes. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of these indicators, we apply them to Canadian price data. To\ncompare the real-time performance of the Markov switching approach to the\nbenchmark model without regime-switching, we assess their abilities to forecast\nheadline inflation and minimize revisions. We find that the Markov switching\nmodel delivers superior predictive accuracy and significantly reduces revisions\nduring periods of substantial inflation changes. Hence, our findings suggest\nthat accounting for time-varying factors and parameters enhances inflation\nsignal accuracy and reduces data requirements, especially following sudden\neconomic shifts.",

We\nconfirm previous studies regarding the disappearance of the HA in the last nine\nmatches of season 2019/20. This drop materialised almost entirely through a\nreduction of home goals. The HA in season 2020/21 (with spectator ban during\nmost matches) was very close to the pre-COVID-19 season 2018/19, indicating\nthat teams became accustomed to the absence of spectators. For season 2021/22,\nwith varying spectator regulations, we detect a U-shaped relationship between\nHA and the stadium utilisation rate, where HA increases considerably for\nmatches with medium stadium utilisation which is associated with a larger\ndifference in running distance between the home and away teams.",

        "abstract": "This study examines conversational business analytics, an approach that\nutilizes AI to address the technical competency gaps that hinder end users from\neffectively using traditional self-service analytics. By facilitating natural\nlanguage interactions, conversational business analytics aims to empower end\nusers to independently retrieve data and generate insights. The analysis\nfocuses on Text-to-SQL as a representative technology for translating natural\nlanguage requests into SQL statements. Developing theoretical models grounded\nin expected utility theory, this study identifies the conditions under which\nconversational business analytics, through partial or full support, can\noutperform delegation to human experts. The results indicate that partial\nsupport, focusing solely on information generation by AI, is viable when the\naccuracy of AI-generated SQL queries leads to a profit that surpasses the\nperformance of a human expert. In contrast, full support includes not only\ninformation generation but also validation through explanations provided by the\nAI, and requires sufficiently high validation effectiveness to be reliable.\nHowever, user-based validation presents challenges, such as misjudgment and\nrejection of valid SQL queries, which may limit the effectiveness of\nconversational business analytics. These challenges underscore the need for\nrobust validation mechanisms, including improved user support, automated\nprocesses, and methods for assessing quality independent of the technical\ncompetency of end users.",

This study aims to fill that gap by quantifying the impact of the\nEuropean Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on online usage\nbehavior over time. We analyzed data from 6,286 websites across 24 industries,\ncovering 10 months before and 18 months after the GDPR's enactment in 2018.\nEmploying a generalized synthetic control estimator, we isolated the short- and\nlong-term effects of the GDPR on user behavior. Our results show that the GDPR\nnegatively affected online usage per website on average; specifically, weekly\nvisits decreased by 4.88% in the first 3 months and 10.02% after 18 months\npost-enactment. At the 18-month mark, these declines translated into average\nrevenue losses of about USD 7 million for e-commerce websites and nearly USD\n2.5 million for ad-based websites. Nonetheless, the GDPR's impact varied across\nwebsite size, industry, and user origin, with some large websites and\nindustries benefiting from the regulation.

This research addresses this specific gap by providing a systematic\nreview and strategic analysis of AI and NLP applications in bank marketing,\nfocusing on their integration across the customer journey and operational\nexcellence. Employing the PRISMA methodology, this study systematically reviews\nexisting literature to assess the current landscape of AI and NLP in bank\nmarketing. Additionally, it incorporates semantic mapping using Sentence\nTransformers and UMAP for strategic gap analysis to identify underexplored\nareas and opportunities for future research.\n  The systematic review reveals limited research specifically focused on NLP\napplications in bank marketing. The strategic gap analysis identifies key areas\nwhere NLP can further enhance marketing strategies, including customer-centric\napplications like acquisition, retention, and personalized engagement, offering\nvaluable insights for both academic research and practical implementation. This\nresearch contributes to the field of bank marketing by mapping the current\nstate of AI and NLP applications and identifying strategic gaps.

Contemporary science increasingly relies\non extensive and varied collaborations to tackle global challenges in fields\nsuch as life sciences, climate science, energy, high-energy physics, astronomy,\nand many others. We argue that existing literature fails to address the\ncollaborative nature of research by overlooking the relationship between\ncoauthorship and scientists productivity. Using the Marginal Cost of Production\n(MCP) approach, we first highlight the methodological limitations of ignoring\nthis relationship, then propose a generalised MCP model to value co-authorship.\nAs a case study, we examine High-Energy Physics (HEP) collaborations at the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, analysing approximately half a million\nscientific outputs by over 50,000 authors from 1990 to 2021. Our findings\nindicate that collaborative adjustments yield monetary valuations for subsets\nof highly collaborative papers up to 3 orders of magnitude higher than previous\nestimates, with elevated values correlating with high research quality. This\nstudy contributes to the literature on research output evaluation, addressing\ndebates in science policy around assessing research performance and impact.

        "abstract": "Carbon credits are a key component of most national and organizational\nclimate strategies. Financing and delivering carbon credits from forest-related\nactivities faces multiple risks at the project and asset levels. Financial\nmechanisms are employed to mitigate risks for investors and project developers,\ncomplemented by non-financial measures such as environmental and social\nsafeguards and physical risk mitigation. Despite these efforts, academic\nresearch highlights that safeguards and climate risk mitigation measures are\nnot efficiently implemented in some carbon projects and that specification of\nenvironmental safeguards remains underdeveloped. Further, environmental and\nsocial risk mitigation capacities may not be integrated into financial\nmechanisms. This text examines how ecosystem capacities can be leveraged and\nvalued for mitigation of and adaptation to physical risks by complementing\ncarbon credits with biodiversity insurance and resilience value.",

        "abstract": "This study explores how refugees' destination preferences evolve during\ntransit, with a focus on Central and Eastern Europe, particularly Romania.\nUsing a mixed-methods approach, we analyse data from the International\nOrganization for Migration's (IOM) Flow Monitoring Surveys and complement it\nwith qualitative insights from focus group discussions with refugees. The\nquantitative analysis reveals that refugees' preferences for destination\ncountries often change during transit, influenced by factors such as safety\nconcerns, asylum conditions, education, and the presence of relatives at the\ndestination. Our results support the application of bounded rationality and\nhuman capital theory, showing that while economic opportunities are important,\nsafety becomes the dominant concern during transit. The qualitative analysis\nadds depth to these findings, highlighting the role of political instability,\nsocial networks, and economic hardships as initial migration drivers.\nAdditionally, the study reveals how refugees reassess their destination choices\nbased on their experiences in transit countries, with Romania emerging as a\nviable settlement destination due to its relative stability and access to\nasylum procedures. This research contributes to migration studies by\nchallenging the traditional view of transit countries and offering new insights\ninto the fluid nature of refugee decision-making.",

We calculate two different low-consumption scenarios, using the UK as a\ncase study: (1) a \"decent living\" scenario, which includes only the bare\nnecessities, and (2) a \"good life\" scenario, which is based on the minimum\nliving standards demanded by UK residents. We compare the resulting footprints\nto the current footprint of the UK, and to the footprints of the US, China,\nIndia, and a global average. Labour footprints are disaggregated by sector,\nskill level, and region of origin.\n  We find that both low-consumption scenarios would still require an\nunsustainable amount of labour and resources at the global scale. The decent\nliving scenario would require a 26-hour working week, and on a per capita\nbasis, 89 GJ of energy use, 5.9 tonnes of emissions, and 5.7 tonnes of used\nmaterials per year. The more socially sustainable good life scenario would\nrequire a 53-hour working week, 165 GJ of energy use, 9.9 tonnes of emissions,\nand 11.5 tonnes of used materials per capita. Both scenarios represent\nsubstantial reductions from the UK's current labour footprint of 68 hours per\nweek, which the UK is only able to sustain by importing a substantial portion\nof its labour from other countries. We conclude that reducing consumption to\nthe level of basic needs is not enough to achieve either social or\nenvironmental sustainability.

Such principles\ntypically include maintaining some degree of anonymity regarding participants'\ndata and/or incident-specific data, adopting non-punitive processes and\nensuring the equitability and fairness of risk sharing. By formalizing key\nconcepts such as the reshuffling property, the source-anonymous contributions\nproperty and the strongly aggregate contributions property, along with their\ngeneralizations, we develop a comprehensive framework that expresses these\nprinciples clearly and defines the relevant rules. To illustrate, we\ndemonstrate that the uniform RS rule, a simple mechanism in which risks are\nshared equally, is the only RS rule that satisfies both the reshuffling\nproperty and the source-anonymous contributions property. This straightforward\naxiomatic characterization of the uniform RS rule serves as a foundation for\nexploring similar principles in two broad classes of risk-sharing rules, which\nwe baptize the $q$-proportional RS rules and the $(q_1,q_2)$-based linear RS\nrules, respectively.

        "abstract": "Surveys are an indispensable source of data for applied economic research;\nhowever, their reliance on self-reported information can introduce bias,\nespecially if core variables such as personal income are misreported. To assess\nthe extent and impact of this misreporting bias, we compare self-reported wages\nfrom the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) with administrative wages from\nsocial security records (IEB) for the same individuals. Using a novel and\nunique data linkage (SOEP-ADIAB), we identify a modest but economically\nsignificant reporting bias, with SOEP respondents underreporting their\nadministrative wages by about 7.3%. This misreporting varies systematically\nwith individual, household, and especially job and firm characteristics. In\nreplicating common empirical analyses in which wages serve as either dependent\nor independent variables, we find that misreporting is consequential for some,\nbut not all estimated relationships. It turns out to be inconsequential for\nexamining the returns to education, but relevant for analyzing the gender wage\ngap. In addition we find that misreporting bias can significantly affect the\nresults when wage is used as the independent variable. Specifically, estimates\nof the wage-satisfaction relationship are substantially overestimated when\nbased on survey data, although this bias is mitigated when focusing on\ninterpersonal changes. Our findings underscore that survey-based measures of\nindividual wages can significantly bias commonly estimated empirical\nrelationships.

The 'Your Care Needs\nYou' (YCNY) intervention, evaluated through a cluster randomised controlled\ntrial (cRCT), aims to empower these patients by providing essential information\nand skills to prepare them for being at home. This study evaluates the\ncost-effectiveness of the YCNY intervention compared to standard care within\nthe UK National Health Service (NHS) over the trial's duration (90 days\npost-discharge). Methods: The economic evaluation utilised individual\npatient-level data from the YCNY cRCT. The analysis was conducted from the\nperspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services. The analysis calculated\nthe adjusted mean differences in costs and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)\nbetween the YCNY intervention and control groups. In our base case, Multilevel\nMixed-Effects Generalised Linear Models (MME-GLM) were employed to account for\nthe hierarchical data structure. Additional alternative scenarios and a\nprobabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess the robustness of\nthe findings. Results: The base case results indicated the YCNY intervention\nreduced costs ({\\pounds}269) and improved outcomes (QALY gain of 0.0057). The\nnet health benefit (NHB) of the YCNY intervention using a cost-effectiveness\nthreshold of {\\pounds}15.000/QALY was 0.0246. These findings suggest the YCNY\nintervention dominates usual care, with a high probability (89%) of the YCNY\nintervention being cost-effective at a {\\pounds}15,000 per QALY threshold. The\nresults remained robust across several alternative scenario analyses.\nDiscussion: The YCNY intervention could represent a promising and potentially\ncost-effective approach for enhancing the safety and experience of older adults\ntransitioning from hospital to home in the UK.",

Instead, we build a\nresume screening algorithm that values exploration by evaluating candidates\naccording to their statistical upside potential. Using data from professional\nservices recruiting within a Fortune 500 firm, we show that this approach\nimproves the quality (as measured by eventual hiring rates) of candidates\nselected for an interview, while also increasing demographic diversity,\nrelative to the firm's existing practices. The same is not true for traditional\nsupervised learning based algorithms, which improve hiring rates but select far\nfewer Black and Hispanic applicants.\n  Together, our results highlight the importance of incorporating exploration\nin developing decision-making algorithms that are potentially both more\nefficient and equitable.",

We\nanalyze shock mitigation actions, such as increasing imports, boosting\nproduction, or substituting food items.

These interactions generate wage\nlevels in logs that exceed the simple sum of worker and firm components, making\nthem challenging for traditional linear models to capture effectively. I find\nthat these ``complementarity effects'' account for approximately 17% of the\ngender wage gap. Larger firms, high human capital, STEM degrees, and managerial\nroles are closely related to it. For instance, among managerial occupations,\nthe match effect goes as high as one-third of the total gap. I also find women\nare less likely to be employed by firms offering higher returns to both human\ncapital and firm-specific premiums, resulting in a significantly larger firm\ncontribution to the gender wage gap than previously estimated. Combined, these\nfactors explain nearly half of the overall gender wage gap, suggesting the\nimportance of understanding firm-worker matches in addressing gender-based pay\ndisparities.",

To our knowledge, the impact of Medicaid\nexpansion on the Medicare population has not been investigated.

A statistical analysis of\napproximately 1.058 million job advertisements in China from 2008 to 2010 found\nthat about 7.7% and 2.6% of companies had explicit requirements regarding\ncandidates' appearance and height, particularly in positions with lower\neducational requirements. Literature review indicates that attractive job\nseekers typically enjoy higher employment opportunities and wages, while\nunattractive individuals face significant income penalties. Regression analysis\nof 1,260 participants reveals a significant positive correlation between\nattractiveness scores and wages, especially in low-education groups.\nConversely, in high-education groups, the influence of appearance on income is\nnot significant. The study suggests that enhancing education levels can\neffectively alleviate income declines associated with appearance, providing\npolicy recommendations to reduce appearance discrimination in the labor market.",

As surveys and opinion polls remain\nkey tools for gauging public attitudes, there is increasing interest in\nassessing whether LLMs can accurately replicate human responses. This study\nexamines the potential of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT-4o, to replicate human\nresponses in large-scale surveys and to predict election outcomes based on\ndemographic data. Employing data from the World Values Survey (WVS) and the\nAmerican National Election Studies (ANES), we assess the LLM's performance in\ntwo key tasks: simulating human responses and forecasting U.S. election\nresults. In simulations, the LLM was tasked with generating synthetic responses\nfor various socio-cultural and trust-related questions, demonstrating notable\nalignment with human response patterns across U.S.-China samples, though with\nsome limitations on value-sensitive topics. In prediction tasks, the LLM was\nused to simulate voting behavior in past U.S. elections and predict the 2024\nelection outcome. Our findings show that the LLM replicates cultural\ndifferences effectively, exhibits in-sample predictive validity, and provides\nplausible out-of-sample forecasts, suggesting potential as a cost-effective\nsupplement for survey-based research.",

Specifically, creators can potentially benefit from content that\nbuilds their own following at the expense of the core game. Our research\ninvestigates the relationship between consuming live-streamed content and\nengagement with a specific video game. We examine the causal effect of viewing\nlive-streamed content on subsequent gameplay for a specific game, using an\nunexpected service interruption of the livestreaming platform and time zone\ndifferences among users. We find live-streamed content significantly increases\ngameplay as a 10% increase in live-streamed viewing minutes results in a 3.08%\nincrease in gameplay minutes. We also explore how this effect varies by user\nloyalty to different types of streamer channels (firm-owned, mega, and micro).\nThe positive effects of live-streamed content are greatest for micro-streamers\nand smallest for mega-streamers.

        "abstract": "Policy efforts have primarily focused on expanding variable renewable energy\nsources (vRES) to meet carbon emission reduction targets. The integration of\nhigh shares of renewables into the energy system is central to both policy\nmaking and research, focusing on the need for balancing options between vRES\nand demand. In this work we analyze and compare three key integration measures:\ngrid expansions, electricity storage, and the role of production, storage and\ntransport of low-carbon hydrogen. We focus on their potential to reduce\nemissions and energy system costs, individually and in combination. We take the\nNorth Sea as an exemplary region with ambitious 2030-2040 targets for offshore\nwind developments. The projections on installed generation and grid capacities,\nalong with demand estimates from the Ten Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP)\n2022, serve as a starting point for our energy system model. This starting\nmodel can then be further expanded with the three integration measures. Our\nfindings show that grid expansions across the North Sea are a no-regret measure\nlowering costs, emissions and required renewable. The production of hydrogen\nand its direct use in industry has a lower cost reduction potential and\nemission reduction potential, while hydrogen storage and transport have little\nto no additional value. In the short term (2030), electricity storage can help\nto reduce emissions, but it is not cost competitive. In the longer term (2040),\nstorage can help to balance investments in vRES assets by providing additional\nflexibility to the system. Combining the three integration measures provides\nadditional benefits. The highest emission reductions can be achieved by\ncombining electricity storage with an expansion of the grid. The highest\neconomic benefits can be achieved with a combination of grid expansions and\nhydrogen production for direct use in industry.",

Layoff-induced\ncandidates are positively selected on various competence measures, suggesting\nthat economic shocks may improve the quality of political entrants. Further, we\nobserve that the increase in candidacies is more pronounced among laid-off\nindividuals with greater financial incentives from office holding and higher\npredicted income losses. Finally, using a regression discontinuity design, we\nfind that eligibility for unemployment benefits increases the likelihood of\nbecoming a party member and running for local office. These results are\nconsistent with the reduction in private-sector opportunity costs and the\nincreased time resources explaining the rise in political entry.",

The answer\ndepends on the type of regulation, monetary and non-monetary factors\ninfluencing demand, technological factors affecting supply elasticities,\ndifference between pre-regulation and expected post-regulation prices, and\ngeographical area. State-level variations in telehealth parity laws provide a\nunique opportunity to study the effects of Price Controls and Cost Controls on\nhealthcare service quantity, proxied by physician count, across metro and\nnon-metro areas, with broadband as a technological mediator. At the micro\nlevel, Price Controls distort the input mix, causing production inefficiency\nand rotating the supply curve. Cost Controls change the consumption mix,\ncausing consumption inefficiency and rotating the demand curve. This results in\nequilibrium quantity shifts causing allocative inefficiency in healthcare\nprovision, signified by physician redistribution at the macro level. The\nmicro-founded non-price competition models predicts shifts from unregulated to\nregulated equilibrium quantities under various combinations of Price Control\nand Cost Control types. Empirical analysis supports these predictions, showing\nthat a Price Ceiling or Price Floor positively affects physician count in metro\nareas but negatively in non-metro areas. Conversely, Cost Parity has a negative\neffect in metro areas, while a Cost Ceiling positively impacts physician count\nin both regions. When examining combinations of different types of Price and\nCost Controls, Cost Parity tends to dominate with a net negative effect,\nwhereas a Cost Ceiling amplifies the positive effect of a Price Ceiling.

        "abstract": "The GCC region includes Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and Oman,\nwhich are of critical geopolitical and economic importance, being rich in oil\nand positioned along vital maritime routes. However, the region faces complex\nsecurity challenges, ranging from traditional threats like interstate conflicts\nto nontraditional risks such as cyber-attacks, piracy, and environmental\nconcerns. This study investigates the safety and security index for six GCC\ncountries using machine learning techniques, specifically XGBoost, to forecast\nsecurity trends for the next five years. Data from the Global Peace Index and\nWorld Bank development indicators were employed to construct the model. Key\nindicators related to economic, political, and environmental factors were\nselected using the Edit Distance on Real Sequence feature selection method. The\nmodel demonstrated high accuracy, with a mean absolute percentage error of less\nthan 10% across all countries. The results indicate that Bahrain and Saudi\nArabia are likely to experience improvements in their safety and security\nindexes. At the same time, Kuwait and Oman may face challenges in maintaining\ntheir current levels of security. The findings suggest that economic\ndiversification, environmental sustainability, and social stability are\ncritical for ensuring long-term security in the region. This study provides\nvaluable insights for policymakers in designing proactive strategies to address\nemerging security threats.",

This innovative\nintegration allows us to model complex interactions and dynamics while\nproviding clear, interpretable results.

By facilitating access to accurate and\ninterpretable medium-term forecasts of AC prices, AGRICAF can contribute to\ndeveloping a fair and sustainable food system.",

        "abstract": "Predicting company growth is crucial for strategic adjustment, operational\ndecision-making, risk assessment, and loan eligibility reviews. Traditional\nmodels for company growth often focus too much on theory, overlooking practical\nforecasting, or they rely solely on time series forecasting techniques,\nignoring interpretability and the inherent mechanisms of company growth. In\nthis paper, we propose a machine learning-based prediction framework that\nincorporates an econophysics model for company growth. Our model captures both\nthe intrinsic growth mechanisms of companies led by scaling laws and the\nfluctuations influenced by random factors and individual decisions,\ndemonstrating superior predictive performance compared with methods that use\ntime series techniques alone. Its advantages are more pronounced in long-range\nprediction tasks. By explicitly modeling the baseline growth and volatility\ncomponents, our model is more interpretable.",

        "abstract": "Online reviews significantly impact consumers' decision-making process and\nfirms' economic outcomes and are widely seen as crucial to the success of\nonline markets. Firms, therefore, have a strong incentive to manipulate ratings\nusing fake reviews. This presents a problem that academic researchers have\ntried to solve over two decades and on which platforms expend a large amount of\nresources. Nevertheless, the prevalence of fake reviews is arguably higher than\never. To combat this, we collect a dataset of reviews for thousands of Amazon\nproducts and develop a general and highly accurate method for detecting fake\nreviews. A unique difference between previous datasets and ours is that we\ndirectly observe which sellers buy fake reviews. Thus, while prior research has\ntrained models using lab-generated reviews or proxies for fake reviews, we are\nable to train a model using actual fake reviews. We show that products that buy\nfake reviews are highly clustered in the product-reviewer network. Therefore,\nfeatures constructed from this network are highly predictive of which products\nbuy fake reviews. We show that our network-based approach is also successful at\ndetecting fake reviews even without ground truth data, as unsupervised\nclustering methods can accurately identify fake review buyers by identifying\nclusters of products that are closely connected in the network. While text or\nmetadata can be manipulated to evade detection, network-based features are more\ncostly to manipulate because these features result directly from the inherent\nlimitations of buying reviews from online review marketplaces, making our\ndetection approach more robust to manipulation.",

We find that excess liquidity emerges\ndue to the interactions between the reserves and liquidity ratio constraints;\nthe appearance of evergreen repurchase agreements and collateral re-use emerges\nas a simple answer to banks' counterparty risk and liquidity ratio regulation.\nIn line with prevailing theories, re-use increases with collateral scarcity. In\nour agent-based model, banks create money endogenously to meet the funding\nrequests of economic agents. The latter generate payment shocks to the banking\nsystem by reallocating their deposits. Banks absorbs these shocks thanks to\nrepurchase agreements, while respecting reserves, liquidity, and leverage\nconstraints. The resulting network is denser and more robust to stress\nscenarios than an unsecured one; in addition, the stable bank trading\nrelationships network exhibits a core-periphery structure. Finally, we show how\nthis model can be used as a tool for stress testing and monetary policy design.",

        "abstract": "A century of plastic usage has led to an accumulation of plastic waste in\nwaterways and oceans. Over time, these wastes break down into particles smaller\nthan 5 microns -- or ''microplastics'' -- which can infiltrate human biological\nsystems. Despite decades of research into this emerging source of environmental\npollution, there is a paucity of direct evidence on the health impacts of\nmicroplastics exposure at a population scale. This paper reports the first\nempirical link between in-utero microplastic exposure and adverse birth\noutcomes. Our analysis is based on a compiled dataset of 3 million births that\noccurred in coastal areas of 15 countries spanning four continents, which we\nmerge with a novel remote-sensing measurements of marine microplastic\nconcentrations. We show that in-utero exposure to microplastics, particularly\nduring the third trimester of pregnancy, leads to a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of low birth weight. A doubling of exposure increases low birth\nweight hazard by 0.37 per 1,000 births, which implies over 205,000 cases per\nyear globally can be attributed to microplastic exposure. We further show that\naerosolization -- whereby microplastic particles become airborne and inhalable\ndue to seawater evaporation -- is an important pathway for health impact, a\nchallenge that is likely to escalate as ocean temperatures continue to rise.",

We start by studying the problem of\nPrincipal with multiple Agents in cooperation. The term cooperation is\nmanifested here by the fact that the agents optimize their criteria through\nPareto equilibria. We show that as the number of agents tends to infinity, the\nprincipal's value function converges to the value function of a McKean--Vlasov\ncontrol problem. Using the solution to this McKean--Vlasov control problem, we\nderive a constructive method for obtaining approximately optimal contracts for\nthe principal's problem with multiple agents in cooperation. In a second step,\nwe show that the problem of Principal with multiple Agents turns out to also\nconverge, when the number of agents goes to infinity, towards a new\nPrincipal--Agent problem which is the Principal--Agent problem with\nMckean--Vlasov dynamics. This is a Principal--Agent problem where the\nagent--controlled production follows a Mckean-Vlasov dynamics and the contract\ncan depend of the distribution of the production. The value function of the\nprincipal in this setting is equivalent to that of the same McKean--Vlasov\ncontrol problem from the multi--agent scenario. Furthermore, we show that an\noptimal contract can be constructed from the solution to this McKean--Vlasov\ncontrol problem. We conclude by discussing, in a simple example, the connection\nof these problems with the multitask Principal--Agent problem which is a\nsituation when a principal delegates multiple tasks that can be correlated to a\nsingle agent.",

        "abstract": "Crowdsourced annotations of data play a substantial role in the development\nof Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is broadly recognised that annotations of\ntext data can contain annotator bias, where systematic disagreement in\nannotations can be traced back to differences in the annotators' backgrounds.\nBeing unaware of such annotator bias can lead to representational bias against\nminority group perspectives and therefore several methods have been proposed\nfor recognising bias or preserving perspectives. These methods typically\nrequire either a substantial number of annotators or annotations per data\ninstance. In this study, we propose a simple method for handling bias in\nannotations without requirements on the number of annotators or instances.\nInstead, we ask annotators about their beliefs of other annotators' judgements\nof an instance, under the hypothesis that these beliefs may provide more\nrepresentative and less biased labels than judgements. The method was examined\nin two controlled, survey-based experiments involving Democrats and Republicans\n(n=1,590) asked to judge statements as arguments and then report beliefs about\nothers' judgements. The results indicate that bias, defined as systematic\ndifferences between the two groups of annotators, is consistently reduced when\nasking for beliefs instead of judgements. Our proposed method therefore has the\npotential to reduce the risk of annotator bias, thereby improving the\ngeneralisability of AI systems and preventing harm to unrepresented\nsocio-demographic groups, and we highlight the need for further studies of this\npotential in other tasks and downstream applications.",

Through comprehensive simulations across the countryside,\nrural, suburban, and urban grid topologies with varying penetration levels of\nthe distributed energy resources, totaling 400 simulation setups, we\ndemonstrate that local energy markets can enhance economic efficiency and grid\nstability with 99 % of the scenarios boasting lower average energy prices and\n80 % lower operational peak power levels. Our findings suggest that local\nenergy markets can play a role in the future energy system, especially in areas\nwith high shares of PV and HP, provided that additional infrastructure,\nmanagement costs, and bureaucratic complexity are kept to a minimum.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in generative AI, exemplified by ChatGPT, have\ndramatically transformed how people access information. Despite its powerful\ncapabilities, the benefits it provides may not be equally distributed among\nindividuals - a phenomenon referred to as the digital divide. Building upon\nprior literature, we propose two forms of digital divide in the generative AI\nadoption process: (i) the learning divide, capturing individuals' heterogeneous\nabilities to update their perceived utility of ChatGPT; and (ii) the utility\ndivide, representing differences in individuals' actual utility derived from\nper use of ChatGPT. To evaluate these two divides, we develop a Bayesian\nlearning model that incorporates demographic heterogeneities in both the\nutility and signal functions. Leveraging a six-month clickstream dataset, we\nestimate the model and find significant learning and utility divides across\nvarious demographic attributes. Interestingly, lower-educated and non-white\nindividuals derive higher utility gains from ChatGPT but learn about its\nutility at a slower rate. Furthermore, males, younger individuals, and those\nwith an IT background not only derive higher utility per use from ChatGPT but\nalso learn about its utility more rapidly. Besides, we document a phenomenon\ntermed the belief trap, wherein users underestimate ChatGPT's utility, opt not\nto use the tool, and consequently lack new experiences to update their\nperceptions, leading to continued underutilization. Our simulation further\ndemonstrates that the learning divide can significantly affect the probability\nof falling into the belief trap, another form of the digital divide in adoption\noutcomes (i.e., outcome divide); however, offering training programs can\nalleviate the belief trap and mitigate the divide.",

Additionally, it examines factors such as trust,\nperformance expectations, social influences, and network externalities to\nidentify the primary determinants influencing Nigerian consumers' propensity to\nadopt EVs. Results show that the percentage increase of H6 (facilitating\nconditions - behavioral intentions) compared to H5 (network externalities -\nbehavioral intentions) is approximately 32.35%, indicating that traditional\ndrivers significantly influence individuals' willingness to purchase EVs and\nare particularly strong factors in adoption decisions.

The analysis is\nconducted for European countries using data on disaggregated industrial\nemployment shares over the period 2010-2018. First, we identify patterns of\nindustrial specialisation by validating a country-industry industrial\nemployment matrix using a bipartite weighted configuration model (BiWCM).\nSecondly, we introduce a country-level measure of labour-weighted Fitness,\nwhich can be decomposed in such a way as to isolate a component that identifies\nthe movement of labour towards more complex industries, which we define as\nstructural change. Thirdly, we link structural change to i) employment growth,\nii) wage inequality, and iii) labour share of the economy. The results indicate\nthat our structural change measure is associated negatively with employment\ngrowth. However, it is also associated with lower income inequality. As\ncountries move to more complex industries, they drop the least complex ones, so\nthe (low-paid) jobs in the least complex sectors disappear.

I explore the origins of\nthis effect with Bayesian hierarchical models and a number-comparison task,\nmirroring the mechanics of the altruism choices absent any altruistic\npreference. The treatment effect is similar in this task, suggesting that a\nbiased perception of numerical magnitudes drives treatment differences. The\nprobabilistic models support this interpretation. A series of additional\nresults show a negative correlation between cognitive reflection and individual\nmeasures of cognitive noise, as well as associations between altruistic choice\nand number comparison.

        "abstract": "What drives formal employment creation in developing cities? We find that\nlarger cities, home to an abundant set of complex industries, employ a larger\nshare of their working age population in formal jobs. We propose a hypothesis\nto explain this pattern, arguing that it is the organised nature of formal\nfirms, whereby workers with complementary skills are coordinated in teams, that\nenables larger cities to create more formal employment. From this perspective,\nthe growth of formal employment is dependent on the ability of a city to build\non existing skills to enter new complex industries. To test our hypothesis, we\nconstruct a variable which captures the skill-proximity of cities' current\nindustrial base to new complex industries, termed 'complexity potential'. Our\nmain result is that complexity potential is robustly associated with subsequent\ngrowth of the formal employment rate in Colombian cities.",

        "abstract": "Bidding is a key element of search advertising, but the variation in bidders'\nvaluations and strategies is often overlooked. Disclosing bid information helps\nuncover this heterogeneity and enables platforms to tailor their disclosure\npolicies to meet objectives like increasing consumer surplus or platform\nrevenue. We analyzed data from a platform that provided bid recommendations\nbased on historical bids. Our findings reveal that advertisers vary\nsignificantly in their strategies: some follow the platform's recommendations,\nwhile others create their own bids, deviating from the provided information.\nThis highlights the need for customized information disclosure policies in\nonline ad marketplaces. We developed an equilibrium model for Generalized\nSecond Price (GSP) auctions, showing that adhering to bid recommendations with\npositive probability is suboptimal. We categorized advertisers as bid-adhering\nor bid-constructing and developed a structural model for self-bidding to\nidentify private valuations. This model allowed for a counterfactual analysis\nof the impact of different levels of information disclosure. Both theoretical\nand empirical results suggest that moderate increases in disclosure improve\nplatform revenue and market efficiency. Understanding bidder diversity is\ncrucial for platforms, which can design more effective disclosure policies to\naddress varying bidder needs and achieve their goals through costless\ninformation sharing.",

Here, we characterize India's economic and human\ndevelopment along with changes in its personal income distribution as a\nfunction of the nation's growing urbanization. On aggregate, we find that India\noutperforms most other nations in the growth of various indicators of\ndevelopment with urbanization, including income and human development. These\nresults are due in part to India's present low levels of urbanization but also\ndemonstrate the transformational role of its cities in driving\nmulti-dimensional development. To test these changes at the more local level,\nwe study the income distributions of large Indian cities to find evidence for\nhigh positive growth in the lowest decile (poorest) of the population, enabling\nsharp reductions in poverty over time. We also test the hypothesis that\ninequality-reducing cities are more attractive destinations for rural migrants.\nFinally, we use income distributions to characterize changes in poverty rates\ndirectly. This shows much lower levels of poverty in urban India and especially\nin its largest cities. The dynamics of poverty rates during the recent COVID-19\npandemic shows both a high fragility of these improvements during a crisis and\ntheir resilience over longer times. Sustaining a long-term dynamic where\nurbanization continues to be closely associated with human development and\npoverty reduction is likely India's fastest path to a more prosperous and\nequitable future.",

The study is\nbased on a rich set of project-level data on FDI-generated jobs. It utilizes a\nlabor demand function estimated through GMM estimator to account for\nendogeneity. Results indicate that forward GVC participation significantly\nboosts FDI-related job creation by enhancing domestic value-added and\nproduction capacity. However, this effect is moderated by sector-specific\ncharacteristics such as productivity or wages. Conversely, backward GVC\nparticipation, characterized by reliance on foreign inputs, generally reduces\nFDI-generated jobs due to lower domestic labor requirements and diminished\ncompetitiveness. Despite this, the negative impact of backward GVC\nparticipation on employment becomes less significant when regional\ndiversification is considered, highlighting the importance of regional factors\nlike infrastructure and skilled labor. The study also finds that the impact of\nGVC participation on employment varies with EU membership status and sectoral\ncharacteristics, with old EU member states and high-tech sectors benefiting\nmore from forward GVC integration. In contrast, new EU member states and\nlow-tech sectors face greater challenges, particularly with backward GVC\nparticipation.",

However, this is\naccompanied with a 41.6% increase in integration time, potentially due to\nhigher coordination costs. Interestingly, we also observe the differential\neffects among developers. We discover that core developers achieve greater\nproject-level productivity gains from using Copilot, benefiting more in terms\nof individual productivity and participation compared to peripheral developers,\nplausibly due to their deeper familiarity with software projects.

AIs with reckless attitudes toward risk (either because they are\ncalibrated to reckless human users or are poorly designed) may pose significant\nthreats. They might also open 'responsibility gaps' in which there is no agent\nwho can be held accountable for harmful actions. What risk attitudes should\nguide an agentic AI's decision-making? How might we design AI systems that are\ncalibrated to the risk attitudes of their users? What guardrails, if any,\nshould be placed on the range of permissible risk attitudes? What are the\nethical considerations involved when designing systems that make risky\ndecisions on behalf of others? We present three papers that bear on key\nnormative and technical aspects of these questions.",

        "abstract": "In an era of \"moving fast and breaking things\", regulators have moved slowly\nto pick up the safety, bias, and legal pieces left in the wake of broken\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) deployment. Since AI models, such as large\nlanguage models, are able to push misinformation and stoke division within our\nsociety, it is imperative for regulators to employ a framework that mitigates\nthese dangers and ensures user safety. While there is much-warranted discussion\nabout how to address the safety, bias, and legal woes of state-of-the-art AI\nmodels, the number of rigorous and realistic mathematical frameworks to\nregulate AI safety is lacking. We take on this challenge, proposing an\nauction-based regulatory mechanism that provably incentivizes model-building\nagents (i) to deploy safer models and (ii) to participate in the regulation\nprocess. We provably guarantee, via derived Nash Equilibria, that each\nparticipating agent's best strategy is to submit a model safer than a\nprescribed minimum-safety threshold. Empirical results show that our regulatory\nauction boosts safety and participation rates by 20% and 15% respectively,\noutperforming simple regulatory frameworks that merely enforce minimum safety\nstandards.",

Indirect exporting dampens the\ninflationary pressure from domestic forces, while indirect importing increases\nthe inflation sensitivity to import price changes.

At\nthe same time, demand for transportation is ever increasing, which in turn\nincreases congestion problems. Combining both challenges, this paper assesses\nthe effectiveness of congestion pricing as a sustainable revenue stream to\noffset fuel tax loss in 2030 while simultaneously enhancing efficiency in the\ntransport sector. A congestion-based toll that is road-and-time-variant is\nsimulated for the greater Berlin area in Germany using the multi-agent\ntransport simulation (MATSim) software. Through the simulation results, this\npaper quantifies the impacts of the toll on the governmental revenue, traffic\nmanagement, environment, social welfare, and the distribution effects. We find\nthat the revenue from congestion tolls in a metropolitan area can compensate\nthe reduction in passenger car fuel tax. Furthermore, a remarkable welfare\nsurplus is observed. The toll also successfully incentivises transport users to\nadjust their travel behaviour, which reduces traffic delay time by 28%. CO2\nemissions as a key metric for decarbonisation of the transport sector decrease\nby more than 5%. The analysis of the distribution effects suggests that a\nredistribution plan with a focus on the middle-low-income residents and the\nouter boroughs could help the policy gain more public acceptance.",

Traditionally,\ndeveloping such domain-specific LLMs has been resource-intensive, requiring a\nlarge dataset and significant computational power for continual pretraining and\ninstruction tuning. Our study proposes a simpler approach that combines\ndomain-specific continual pretraining with model merging. Given that\ngeneral-purpose pretrained LLMs and their instruction-tuned LLMs are often\npublicly available, they can be leveraged to obtain the necessary instruction\ntask vector. By merging this with a domain-specific pretrained vector, we can\neffectively create instruction-tuned LLMs for finance without additional\ninstruction data. Our process involves two steps: first, we perform continual\npretraining on financial data; second, we merge the instruction-tuned vector\nwith the domain-specific pretrained vector. Our experiments demonstrate the\nsuccessful construction of instruction-tuned LLMs for finance. One major\nadvantage of our method is that the instruction-tuned and domain-specific\npretrained vectors are nearly independent. This independence makes our approach\nhighly effective.

We use a common value framework to analyze this\nauction mechanism, detailing its operation, share allocation, and pricing. The\ntheoretical findings suggest that when buyers bid truthfully, the seller's\noptimal strategy is to set the total share quantity equal to the target revenue\ndivided by the reserve price. We demonstrate that committing to a target\nrevenue results in a higher level of truthful bidding compared to a standard\nuniform-price auction without any revenue commitment. We empirically test our\ntheoretical findings using data from China's SEO markets. First, we assess the\nimpact of various issuer strategies on firm-level SEO discounts, categorizing\nscenarios based on share availability and target revenue. We find that the\nscenario where the reserve price times the share quantity matches the target\nrevenue is the most optimal for sellers. Second, we examine bidding behavior\nand auction performance, showing that China's SEO uniform price auction\nperforms exceptionally well. Specifically, the actual issue prices are only\n0.029 below the truthful case prices, indicating that the revenue raised is\nstill close to what would have been achieved with truthful bids.",

        "abstract": "In social dilemmas where the collective and self-interests are at odds,\npeople typically cooperate less with machines than with fellow humans, a\nphenomenon termed the machine penalty. Overcoming this penalty is critical for\nsuccessful human-machine collectives, yet current solutions often involve\nethically-questionable tactics, like concealing machines' non-human nature. In\nthis study, with 1,152 participants, we explore the possibility of closing this\nresearch question by using Large Language Models (LLMs), in scenarios where\ncommunication is possible between interacting parties. We design three types of\nLLMs: (i) Cooperative, aiming to assist its human associate; (ii) Selfish,\nfocusing solely on maximizing its self-interest; and (iii) Fair, balancing its\nown and collective interest, while slightly prioritizing self-interest. Our\nfindings reveal that, when interacting with humans, fair LLMs are able to\ninduce cooperation levels comparable to those observed in human-human\ninteractions, even when their non-human nature is fully disclosed. In contrast,\nselfish and cooperative LLMs fail to achieve this goal. Post-experiment\nanalysis shows that all three types of LLMs succeed in forming mutual\ncooperation agreements with humans, yet only fair LLMs, which occasionally\nbreak their promises, are capable of instilling a perception among humans that\ncooperating with them is the social norm, and eliciting positive views on their\ntrustworthiness, mindfulness, intelligence, and communication quality. Our\nfindings suggest that for effective human-machine cooperation, bot\nmanufacturers should avoid designing machines with mere rational\ndecision-making or a sole focus on assisting humans. Instead, they should\ndesign machines capable of judiciously balancing their own interest and the\ninterest of humans.",

Human external evaluators have scored creative outputs generated\nby humans and AI, and these subjective creative scores were complemented with\nobjective measures based on quantitative measurements and NLP tools. The\nresults reveal that AI generally outperforms humans in creative tasks, though\nthis advantage is nuanced by the specific nature of each task and the chosen\ncreativity criteria. Ultimately, while AI demonstrates superior performance in\ncertain creative domains, our results suggest that integrating human feedback\nis crucial for maximizing AI's creative potential.",

        "abstract": "In the last few years, economic agent-based models have made the transition\nfrom qualitative models calibrated to match stylised facts to quantitative\nmodels for time series forecasting, and in some cases, their predictions have\nperformed as well or better than those of standard models (see, e.g. Poledna et\nal. (2023a); Hommes et al. (2022); Pichler et al. (2022)). Here, we build on\nthe model of Poledna et al., adding several new features such as housing\nmarkets, realistic synthetic populations of individuals with income, wealth and\nconsumption heterogeneity, enhanced behavioural rules and market mechanisms,\nand an enhanced credit market. We calibrate our model for all 38 OECD member\ncountries using state-of-the-art approximate Bayesian inference methods and\ntest it by making out-of-sample forecasts. It outperforms both the Poledna and\nAR(1) time series models by a highly statistically significant margin. Our\nmodel is built within a platform we have developed, making it easy to build,\nrun, and evaluate alternative models, which we hope will encourage future work\nin this area.",

        "abstract": "Can human decision-makers learn from AI feedback? Using data on 52,000\ndecision-makers from a large online chess platform, we investigate how their AI\nuse affects three interrelated long-term outcomes: Learning, skill gap, and\ndiversity of decision strategies. First, we show that individuals are far more\nlikely to seek AI feedback in situations in which they experienced success\nrather than failure. This AI feedback seeking strategy turns out to be\ndetrimental to learning: Feedback on successes decreases future performance,\nwhile feedback on failures increases it. Second, higher-skilled decision-makers\nseek AI feedback more often and are far more likely to seek AI feedback after a\nfailure, and benefit more from AI feedback than lower-skilled individuals. As a\nresult, access to AI feedback increases, rather than decreases, the skill gap\nbetween high- and low-skilled individuals. Finally, we leverage 42 major\nplatform updates as natural experiments to show that access to AI feedback\ncauses a decrease in intellectual diversity of the population as individuals\ntend to specialize in the same areas. Together, those results indicate that\nlearning from AI feedback is not automatic and using AI correctly seems to be a\nskill itself. Furthermore, despite its individual-level benefits, access to AI\nfeedback can have significant population-level downsides including loss of\nintellectual diversity and an increasing skill gap.",

We establish that these skills are systematically related to human\ncapital investments such as different types of schooling and work experience.\nThe average profile of the number of reported skills by age looks remarkably\nsimilar to the well-established concave age-earnings profiles. More experienced\nworkers and those with higher educational degrees have larger shares of\noccupation-specific skills, consistent with their acquisition through\nprofessional-degree programs and on-the-job experience. Workers who report\nmore, and particularly more specific and managerial, skills are more likely to\nhold highly paid jobs. Skill differences across workers can account for more\nearnings variation than detailed vectors of education and experience. We also\ndocument a substantial gender gap in reported skills, which starts to manifest\nwhen young women reach typical ages of first motherhood. Gender differences in\nskill profiles can rationalize a substantial proportion of the gender gap in\nthe propensity to work in highly paid jobs. Overall, the results are consistent\nwith an important role of multidimensional skills in accounting for several\nwell-known basic labor-market patterns.",

Further work could include public-private collaboration to\nexplore anchoring all forms of UK retail digital money.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the cost-efficiency aspect of Reinforcement Learning\nfrom Human Feedback (RLHF). RLHF leverages datasets of human preferences over\noutputs of large language models (LLM)s to instill human expectations into\nLLMs. Although preference annotation comes with a monetized cost, the economic\nutility of a preference dataset has not been considered by far. What\nexacerbates this situation is that, given complex intransitive or cyclic\nrelationships in preference datasets, existing algorithms for fine-tuning LLMs\nare still far from capturing comprehensive preferences. This raises severe\ncost-efficiency concerns in production environments, where preference data\naccumulate over time. In this paper, we discuss the fine-tuning of LLMs as a\nmonetized economy and introduce an auction mechanism to improve the efficiency\nof preference data collection in dollar terms. We show that introducing an\nauction mechanism can play an essential role in enhancing the cost-efficiency\nof RLHF, while maintaining satisfactory model performance. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed auction-based protocol is cost-effective for\nfine-tuning LLMs concentrating on high-quality feedback.",

The population\nperspective in Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics\nfor a New Era serves as the fundamental guide for population policies. The\nthree-child policy and delayed retirement will affect the supply of labor in\nChina and challenge the previous assessments of China's Lewis Turning Point.\nThis study examines the rural surplus labor transfer from 2013 to 2022 based on\nurban and rural data. The results indicate that China's overall wage levels\nhave continuously increased, the urban-rural income gap has narrowed, and the\ntransfer of surplus rural labor has slowed. China has passed the first turning\npoint and entered a transitional phase. Factors such as the level of\nagricultural mechanization, urbanization rate, and urban-rural income gap are\nmore significant in influencing the transfer of surplus labor than the normal\nworking-age population ratio. The delayed retirement policy has a more\nimmediate impact on the supply and transfer of rural surplus labor than the\nthree-child policy. Additionally, delayed retirement can offset the negative\nimpact of the reduced relative surplus labor supply caused by the three-child\npolicy, although the three-child policy could increase the future absolute\nsurplus labor supply.",

        "abstract": "This paper empirically investigates how an individual's network influences\ntheir purchase and subsequent use of experience goods. Utilising data on the\nnetwork and game-ownership of over 108 million users from the world's largest\nvideo game platform, we analyse whether a user's friendship network influences\ntheir decision to purchase single-player video games. Our identification\nstrategy uses an instrumental variable (IV) approach that employs the temporal\nlag of purchasing decisions from second degree friends. We find strong peer\neffects in the individual game adoption in the contemporary week. The effect is\nstronger if the friend who purchased the game is an old friend compared to a\nkey player in the friendship network. Comparing the results to adoption\ndecisions for a major label game, we find peer effects of a similar size and\nduration. However, the time subsequently spent playing the games is higher for\nplayers who were neither influenced by a peer who is a key player nor an old\nfriend. Considering the increasing importance of online networks on consumption\ndecisions, our findings offer some first insights on the heterogeneity of peer\neffects between old and key player friends and also provide evidence in\nconsumers' biases in social learning.",

        "abstract": "Many socio-economic systems require positive economic growth rates to\nfunction properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing\nevidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,\nthese growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,\nmore and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems\nand develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of\n'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,\nwhich impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article\nproposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the\nconcept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a\ngeneral definition consisting of four components that can be specified for\ndifferent empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of\nmeasurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions\nor properties of the system under investigation. According to our general\ndefinition, a socio-economic system is growth-dependent if it requires a\nlong-term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to\nmaintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen\nnormative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to\nthree areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:\nemployment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies\ndemonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on\nthe empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of\nthe concept of growth dependence. Our framework enables coherent, robust and\neffective definitions and research questions, fostering comparability of\nfindings across different cases and disciplines.",

To this end,\nwe propose a day-to-day traffic behavior modeling framework based on the\nCognitive Hierarchy theory, in which travelers with different levels of\nstrategic-reasoning capabilities form their own beliefs about lower-step\ntravelers' capabilities when choosing their routes. Two widely-studied\nday-to-day models, the Network Tatonnement Process dynamic and the Logit\ndynamic, are extended into the framework and studied as examples. Calibration\nof the virtual experiment is performed using the extended Network Tatonnement\nProcess dynamic, which fits the experimental data reasonably well. We show that\nthe two extended dynamics have multiple equilibria, one of which is the\nclassical user equilibrium. While analyzing global stability is intractable due\nto the presence of multiple equilibria, local stabilities near equilibria are\ndeveloped analytically and verified by numerical experiments.

One\npromising approach involves the creation of a centralized knowledge repository\ncataloguing historical waste-to-resource transactions, which subsequently\nenables the generation of recommendations based on past successes. However, a\nsignificant barrier to constructing such a knowledge repository lies in the\nabsence of a universally standardized framework for representing business\nactivities across disparate geographical regions. To address this challenge,\nthis paper leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to classify textual data\ndescribing economic activities into the International Standard Industrial\nClassification (ISIC), a globally recognized economic activity classification\nframework. This approach enables any economic activity descriptions provided by\nbusinesses worldwide to be categorized into the unified ISIC standard,\nfacilitating the creation of a centralized knowledge repository. Our approach\nachieves a 95% accuracy rate on a 182-label test dataset with fine-tuned GPT-2\nmodel. This research contributes to the global endeavour of fostering\nsustainable circular economy practices by providing a standardized foundation\nfor knowledge codification and recommendation systems deployable across\nregions.",

        "abstract": "When analyzing Bitcoin users' balance distribution, we observed that it\nfollows a log-normal pattern. Drawing parallels from the successful application\nof Gibrat's law of proportional growth in explaining city size and word\nfrequency distributions, we tested whether the same principle could account for\nthe log-normal distribution in Bitcoin balances. However, our calculations\nrevealed that the exponent parameters in both the drift and variance terms\ndeviate slightly from one. This suggests that Gibrat's proportional growth rule\nalone does not fully explain the log-normal distribution observed in Bitcoin\nusers' balances. During our exploration, we discovered an intriguing\nphenomenon: Bitcoin users tend to fall into two distinct categories based on\ntheir behavior, which we refer to as ``poor\" and ``wealthy\" users. Poor users,\nwho initially purchase only a small amount of Bitcoin, tend to buy more\nbitcoins first and then sell out all their holdings gradually over time. The\ncertainty of selling all their coins is higher and higher with time. In\ncontrast, wealthy users, who acquire a large amount of Bitcoin from the start,\ntend to sell off their holdings over time. The speed at which they sell their\nbitcoins is lower and lower over time and they will hold at least a small part\nof their initial holdings at last. Interestingly, the wealthier the user, the\nlarger the proportion of their balance and the higher the certainty they tend\nto sell. This research provided an interesting perspective to explore bitcoin\nusers' behaviors which may apply to other finance markets.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces an economic framework to assess optimal longevity risk\ntransfers between institutions, focusing on the interactions between a buyer\nexposed to long-term longevity risk and a seller offering longevity protection.\nWhile most longevity risk transfers have occurred in the reinsurance sector,\nwhere global reinsurers provide long-term protections, the capital market for\nlongevity risk transfer has struggled to gain traction, resulting in only a few\nshort-term instruments. We investigate how differences in risk aversion between\nthe two parties affect the equilibrium structure of longevity risk transfer\ncontracts, contrasting `static' contracts that offer long-term protection with\n`dynamic' contracts that provide short-term, variable coverage. Our analysis\nshows that static contracts are preferred by more risk-averse buyers, while\ndynamic contracts are favored by more risk-averse sellers who are reluctant to\ncommit to long-term agreements. When incorporating information asymmetry\nthrough ambiguity, we find that ambiguity can cause more risk-averse sellers to\nstop offering long-term contracts. With the assumption that global reinsurers,\nacting as sellers in the reinsurance sector and buyers in the capital market,\nare generally less risk-averse than other participants, our findings provide\ntheoretical explanations for current market dynamics and suggest that\nshort-term instruments offer valuable initial steps toward developing an\nefficient and active capital market for longevity risk transfer.",

It offers strategies to mitigate this risk and provides guidance\nfor future AI-based studies to enhance their collective impact and relevance.\nDrawing on Akerlof's renowned market-for-lemons concept, we identify the\npotential for significant knowledge asymmetries emerging from the field's\nevolution into its current landscape (e.g., complexities around construct\nvalidity, theory building, and research relevance). Such asymmetries are\nparticularly deeply ingrained due to what we term the double-black-box puzzle,\nwhere the widely recognized black box nature of AI methods intersects with the\nblack box nature of the entrepreneurship phenomenon driven by inherent\nuncertainty. As a result, these asymmetries could lead to an increase in\nsuboptimal research products that go undetected, collectively creating a market\nfor lemons that undermines the field's well-being, reputation, and impact.\nHowever, importantly, if these risks can be mitigated, the AI revolution could\nherald a new golden era for entrepreneurship research.

While it is also likely to transform processes in a\ncollaborative work setting, it is unclear what trajectory this transformation\nwill follow. Collaborative environment is characterized by a blend of\norigination tasks that involve building something from scratch and iteration\ntasks that involve refining on others' work. Whether GenAI affects these two\naspects of collaborative work and to what extent is an open empirical question.\nWe study this question within the open-source development landscape, a prime\nexample of collaborative innovation, where contributions are voluntary and\nunguided. Specifically, we focus on the launch of GitHub Copilot in October\n2021 and leverage a natural experiment in which GitHub Copilot (a\nprogramming-focused LLM) selectively rolled out support for Python, but not for\nR. We observe a significant jump in overall contributions, suggesting that\nGenAI effectively augments collaborative innovation in an unguided setting.\nInterestingly, Copilot's launch increased maintenance-related contributions,\nwhich are mostly iterative tasks involving building on others' work,\nsignificantly more than code-development contributions, which are mostly\norigination tasks involving standalone contributions. This disparity was\nexacerbated in active projects with extensive coding activity, raising concerns\nthat, as GenAI models improve to accommodate richer context, the gap between\norigination and iterative solutions may widen.

        "abstract": "Reward schemes may affect not only agents' effort, but also their incentives\nto gather information to reduce the riskiness of the productive activity. In a\nlaboratory experiment using a novel task, we find that the relationship between\nincentives and evidence gathering depends critically on the availability of\ninformation about peers' strategies and outcomes. When no peer information is\navailable, competitive rewards can be associated with more evidence gathering\nthan noncompetitive rewards. In contrast, when decision-makers know what or how\ntheir peers are doing, competitive rewards schemes are associated with less\nactive evidence gathering than noncompetitive schemes. The nature of the\nfeedback -- whether subjects receive information about peers' strategies,\noutcomes, or both -- also affects subjects' incentives to engage in evidence\ngathering. Specifically, only combined feedback about peers' strategies and\nperformance -- from which subjects may assess the overall relationship between\nevidence gathering, riskiness, and success -- is associated with less evidence\ngathering when rewards are based on relative performance; we find no similar\neffect for noncompetitive rewards.",

Little is known about how\nreceipt of LCS affects healthcare costs in real-world clinical settings.\n  Methods: This retrospective study analyzed utilization and cost data from the\nPopulation-based Research to Optimize the Screening Process Lung Consortium. We\nincluded individuals who met age and smoking LCS eligibility criteria and were\nengaged within four healthcare systems between February 5, 2015, and December\n31, 2021. Generalized linear models estimated healthcare costs from the payer\nperspective during 12-months prior and 12-months post baseline LCS. We compared\nthese costs to eligible individuals who did not receive LCS. Sensitivity\nanalyses expanded our sample to age-eligible individuals with any smoking\nhistory noted in the electronic health record. Secondary analyses examined\ncosts among a sample diagnosed with lung cancer. We reported mean predicted\ncosts with average values for all other explanatory variables.\n  Results: We identified 10,049 eligible individuals who received baseline LCS\nand 15,233 who did not receive baseline LCS. Receipt of baseline LCS was\nassociated with additional costs of $3,698 compared to individuals not\nreceiving LCS. Secondary analyses showed suggestive evidence that LCS prior to\ncancer diagnosis decreased healthcare costs compared to cancer diagnosed\nwithout screening.\n  Conclusion: These findings suggest LCS increases healthcare costs in the year\nfollowing screening. However, LCS also improves early-stage cancer detection\nand may reduce treatment costs following diagnosis. These results can inform\nfuture simulation models to guide LCS recommendations, and aid health policy\ndecision makers on resource allocation.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates how the OECD's global minimum tax (GMT) affects\nmultinational enterprises (MNEs) behavior and countries' corporate taxes. We\nconsider both profit shifting and capital investment responses of the MNE in a\nformal model of tax competition between asymmetric countries. The GMT reduces\nthe true tax rate differential and benefits the large country, while the\nrevenue effect is generally ambiguous for the small country. In the short run\nwhere tax rates are fixed, due to tax deduction of the substance-based income\nexclusion (SBIE), a higher minimum rate exerts investment incentives but also\nincurs a larger revenue loss for the small country. We show that under high\n(low) profit shifting costs the former (latter) effect dominates so that the\nsmall country's revenue increases (decreases). In the long run where countries\ncan adjust tax rates, the GMT reshapes the tax game and the competition\npattern. In contrast to the existing literature, we reveal that the minimum\nrate binds the small country only if it is low. With the rise of the GMT rate,\ncountries will undercut the minimum to boost real investments and collect\ntop-up taxes. For small market-size asymmetry and intermediate profit shifting\ncost, the revenue loss from the elimination of profit shifting may dominate the\nrevenue gain from taxing the true profits generated by substantive activities,\nso that even a marginal GMT reform may harm the small country. Otherwise, it\ncan raise the small country's tax revenue.",

By analyzing micro-level transactions of second-hand houses from\nLianjia in ten major Chinese cities from 2016 to 2022, this research\ninvestigates how the transaction patterns of traditional brokerages,\ncharacterized by the strategic clustering of offline stores, transition towards\nplatform-mediated consolidation, thereby facilitating the development of an\nextensive franchise network. Utilizing a regression discontinuity design (RDD),\nthis study quantifies the optimal influence radius of offline stores (410\nmeters) on housing transactions. this study empirically estimates the effects\nof real estate brokerage's offline store expansion and platform-mediated\nconsolidation on transaction properties. The results indicate that this\nstrategy significantly boosts revenues and attracts more people to housing\ntours. Additionally, the results suggest that neither the platform-mediated\nstrategy nor offline expansion affects the transaction period, but offline\nstore expansion can reduce the price gap between sellers and buyers.\nFurthermore, this study introduces a measure of network effect, revealing that\nLianjia's offline stores exhibit a local clustering pattern with moderate\nnetwork strength. The analysis of platform-mediated consolidation indicates a\nsignificantly positive effect on network strength. This study provides valuable\ninsights into the synergy between offline store expansion and online platform\ndevelopment, elucidating future trajectories in the evolving real estate\nbrokerage market and analogous sectors.",

In this work, we study this issue from both an economic and an\nalgorithmic point of view, focusing on a phenomenon that reduces barriers to\nentry. Specifically, an incumbent company risks reputational damage unless its\nmodel is sufficiently aligned with safety objectives, whereas a new company can\nmore easily avoid reputational damage. To study this issue formally, we define\na multi-objective high-dimensional regression framework that captures\nreputational damage, and we characterize the number of data points that a new\ncompany needs to enter the market. Our results demonstrate how multi-objective\nconsiderations can fundamentally reduce barriers to entry -- the required\nnumber of data points can be significantly smaller than the incumbent company's\ndataset size. En route to proving these results, we develop scaling laws for\nhigh-dimensional linear regression in multi-objective environments, showing\nthat the scaling rate becomes slower when the dataset size is large, which\ncould be of independent interest.",

We outline different\nmeteorological scenarios to explore the impacts of both average climatic\nchanges and the intensification of extreme weather events. We find that\naddressing extreme weather in power system planning will require an extra 5-8\nGW of photovoltaic (PV) capacity, on top of the 50 GW of the additional solar\nPV capacity required by the mitigation target alone. Despite the higher initial\ninvestments, we find that the adoption of renewable technologies, especially\nPV, alleviates the power system's vulnerability to climate change and extreme\nweather events. Furthermore, enhancing short-term storage with lithium-ion\nbatteries is crucial to counterbalance the reduced availability of dispatchable\nhydro generation.",

Our sample comprises over 25,000 East German inventors, whose\npatenting careers in reunified Germany post-1990 are traced using a novel\ndisambiguation and matching procedure. Our findings reveal that East German\ninventors in technological fields where access to Western knowledge was\nfacilitated by industrial espionage were more likely to pursue\ninter-organizational mobility and continue their inventive activities in\nreunified Germany. Additionally, inventors from communities with strong\npolitical support for the ruling socialist party encountered difficulties in\nsourcing knowledge through weak ties, resulting in a lower likelihood of\ncontinuing to patent.

        "abstract": "We build on the interpretation of the Economic Complexity method as\nCorrespondence Analysis (CA), and propose that the Canonical form of CA (CCA),\nwhich originated in the ecology literature, can be used to calculate\nmulti-dimensional economic complexity. The traditional (CA) way of calculating\neconomic complexity includes no \"external\" information such as countries'\ndevelopment characteristics to facilitate interpretation of \"complexity\". This\nhas led to a wide range of fairly ad hoc interpretations of economic complexity\non the basis of ex-post correlation to a long list of other variables. By the\nex-ante inclusion of a number of country variables in the construction of the\ncomplexity indicators, CCA enables better interpretation, also in the case of\nmulti-dimensional indicators. The analysis is further facilitated by another\nelement of the ecologists' toolbox, the so-called biplots, which are CCA-based\ngraph embeddings that represent a lower-dimensional product-space in which\nproducts and countries are positioned together, in mutual correspondence to\neach other. We show that in this way, CCA provides a richer account of\ndevelopment in many of its aspects, especially economic growth.",

        "abstract": "Strategic shrouding of taxes by profit-maximizing firms can impair the\neffectiveness of corrective taxes. This paper explores tax shrouding and its\nconsequences after the introduction of a digital sin tax designed to discourage\nharmful overconsumption of online sports betting in Germany. In response to the\ntax reform, most firms strategically shroud the tax, i.e., exclude tax\nsurcharges from posted prices. Using an extensive novel panel data set on\nonline betting odds, I causally estimate the effect of the tax on consumer\nbetting prices. Consumers bear, on average, 76% of the tax burden. There is\nconsiderable and long-lasting heterogeneity in effects conditional on shrouding\npractices. Firms that shroud taxes can pass 90% of the tax onto consumers,\nwhile the pass-through rate is 16% for firms that directly post tax-inclusive\nprices. To understand the results' underlying mechanisms and policy\nimplications, I propose an optimal corrective taxation model where\noligopolistic firms compete on base prices and can shroud additive taxes. Tax\nshrouding is only attainable in equilibrium if (some) consumers underreact to\nshrouded attributes. According to the theoretical predictions, the empirically\nidentified heterogeneity suggests that strategic tax shrouding significantly\nattenuates the positive corrective welfare effects of the tax.

Results reveal significant global\nsentiment variations influenced by economic factors, with more developed\nnations engaging more in discussions, while less developed countries show\nhigher sentiment levels. Geographically weighted regression indicates that\nGDP-tweet engagement correlation intensifies following Bitcoin price surges.\nTopic modeling shows that countries within similar economic clusters share\ndiscussion trends, while different clusters focus on distinct topics.

Here, we conduct\na large-scale study replicating 154 psychological experiments from top social\nscience journals with 618 main effects and 138 interaction effects using GPT-4\nas a simulated participant. We find that GPT-4 successfully replicates 76.0\npercent of main effects and 47.0 percent of interaction effects observed in the\noriginal studies, closely mirroring human responses in both direction and\nsignificance. However, only 19.44 percent of GPT-4's replicated confidence\nintervals contain the original effect sizes, with the majority of replicated\neffect sizes exceeding the 95 percent confidence interval of the original\nstudies.

        "abstract": "One key in real-life Nash equilibrium applications is to calibrate players'\ncost functions. To leverage the approximation ability of neural networks, we\nproposed a general framework for optimizing and learning Nash equilibrium using\nneural networks to estimate players' cost functions. Depending on the\navailability of data, we propose two approaches (a) the two-stage approach: we\nneed the data pair of players' strategy and relevant function value to first\nlearn the players' cost functions by monotonic neural networks or graph neural\nnetworks, and then solve the Nash equilibrium with the learned neural networks;\n(b) the joint approach: we use the data of partial true observation of the\nequilibrium and contextual information (e.g., weather) to optimize and learn\nNash equilibrium simultaneously. The problem is formulated as an optimization\nproblem with equilibrium constraints and solved using a modified\nBackpropagation Algorithm. The proposed methods are validated in numerical\nexperiments.",

        "abstract": "The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into wholesale energy\nmarkets can greatly enhance grid flexibility, improve market efficiency, and\ncontribute to a more sustainable energy future. As DERs -- such as solar PV\npanels and energy storage -- proliferate, effective mechanisms are needed to\nensure that small prosumers can participate meaningfully in these markets. We\nstudy a wholesale market model featuring multiple DER aggregators, each\ncontrolling a portfolio of DER resources and bidding into the market on behalf\nof the DER asset owners. The key of our approach lies in recognizing the\nrepeated nature of market interactions the ability of participants to learn and\nadapt over time. Specifically, Aggregators repeatedly interact with each other\nand with other suppliers in the wholesale market, collectively shaping\nwholesale electricity prices (aka the locational marginal prices (LMPs)). We\nmodel this multi-agent interaction using a mean-field game (MFG), which uses\nmarket information -- reflecting the average behavior of market participants --\nto enable each aggregator to predict long-term LMP trends and make informed\ndecisions. For each aggregator, because they control the DERs within their\nportfolio under certain contract structures, we employ a mean-field control\n(MFC) approach (as opposed to a MFG) to learn an optimal policy that maximizes\nthe total rewards of the DERs under their management. We also propose a\nreinforcement learning (RL)-based method to help each agent learn optimal\nstrategies within the MFG framework, enhancing their ability to adapt to market\nconditions and uncertainties. Numerical simulations show that LMPs quickly\nreach a steady state in the hybrid mean-field approach. Furthermore, our\nresults demonstrate that the combination of energy storage and mean-field\nlearning significantly reduces price volatility compared to scenarios without\nstorage.",

Financial commitments that do not\nconsider the capital structure of green finance in an economy will cumulatively\ndis-aggregate the economic cost of climate investment, to erode the competitive\nadvantage of the most innovative economies, while simultaneously imposing the\ngreatest financial burden on economies that are most vulnerable to the impact\nof climate change; such disaggregation will also leave 'middle' economies in a\nstate of flux - honouring similar financial commitments to vulnerable or highly\ndeveloped peers, but unable to generate comparable return, yet sufficiently\ninsulated from the impact of extreme climate phenomena to not organically\ndevelop solutions.\n  In the face of these changing realities, green innovation needs to expand\nbeyond technology and address systemic inefficiencies - lack of clear\nresponsibility, ambiguously defined commitments, and inadequate checks &\nbalances to name a few.\n  Clever application of financial engineering demonstrates promise, and simple\nmeasures like carbon-credit exchanges have been effective in mitigating\nimperfections at the grassroots level.

UMs are\ndesigned to incentivize incremental and adaptive innovation through lower\nnovelty standards than patents, but their long-term impact on the capability\nacquisition process remains underexplored. Using South Korea as a case study\nand drawing on the characteristics of technological regimes in catching-up\neconomies, we present three key findings: First, the country's post-catch-up\nfrontier technologies (U.S. patents) are more impactful (highly cited) when\nthey build on Korean domestic UMs. This suggests that UM-based imitative and\nadaptive learning laid the foundation for the country's globally competitive\ncapabilities. Second, the impact of UM-based learning diminishes as the\ncountry's economy develops. Third, frontier technologies rooted in UMs\ncontribute more to the country's own specialization than to follow-on\ninnovations by foreign actors, compared to technologies without UM linkages. We\ndiscuss how technological regimes and industrial policies in catching-up\neconomies interact with the UM system to bridge the catching-up (imitation- and\nadaptation-based) and post-catching-up (specialization- and creativity-based)\nphases.",

As Social Choice Theory has shown, the problem of designing algorithms\nfor aggregation rules with specific properties (axioms) can be difficult, or\nprovably impossible in some cases. Instead of designing algorithms by hand, one\ncan learn aggregation rules, particularly voting rules, from data. However, the\nprior work in this area has required extremely large models, or been limited by\nthe choice of preference representation, i.e., embedding. We recast the problem\nof designing a good voting rule into one of learning probabilistic versions of\nvoting rules that output distributions over a set of candidates. Specifically,\nwe use neural networks to learn probabilistic social choice functions from the\nliterature. We show that embeddings of preference profiles derived from the\nsocial choice literature allows us to learn existing voting rules more\nefficiently and scale to larger populations of voters more easily than other\nwork if the embedding is tailored to the learning objective. Moreover, we show\nthat rules learned using embeddings can be tweaked to create novel voting rules\nwith improved axiomatic properties.

Therefore, we propose a new method based on the\nhybrid neural network model CNN-BiGRU-SSA. The goal is to achieve accurate\nprediction and optimization of cross-border commodity pricing strategies\nthrough in-depth analysis and optimization of time series data. Our model\nundergoes experimental validation across multiple datasets. The results show\nthat our method achieves significant performance advantages on datasets such as\nUNCTAD, IMF, WITS and China Customs.

On the IMF and WITS datasets, our method also\nachieves similar excellent performance.

Overall, this study provides an important reference for\nenterprises to formulate more reasonable and effective cross-border commodity\npricing strategies, thereby enhancing market competitiveness and profitability.\nAt the same time, our method also lays a foundation for the application of deep\nlearning in the fields of international trade and economic strategy\noptimization, which has important theoretical and practical significance.",

The lower level (household's) problem is an optimal\nstopping formulation, which captures the adoption decisions of the households.\nWe derive a closed-form expression for the distribution of optimal adoption\ntime of households for a given subsidy policy. We show that the planner's\nproblem is convex in the case of homogeneous subsidy for the two products.\n{Managerial implications:} Our results underscore the importance for planners\nto consider three factors - adoption level target, time target, and subsidy\nbudget - simultaneously as they work in tandem to influence the adoption\noutcome. The planners must also consider the inclusion of community solar in\ntheir plans because, as we show, community and rooftop solar attract households\nfrom different sides of the income spectrum. In the presence of income\ninequality, the availability of community makes it easier to meet solar\nadoption targets.",

In this study, we examine a\nscenario in which two autonomous agents, modeled with Double Deep Q-Learning,\nlearn to liquidate the same asset optimally in the presence of market impact,\nusing the Almgren-Chriss (2000) framework. Our results show that the strategies\nlearned by the agents deviate significantly from the Nash equilibrium of the\ncorresponding market impact game.

However, currently, most\nstudies fail to consider the impact of government policy preferences and data\nuncertainty on carbon emission efficiency. To address the above limitations,\nthis study proposes a hybrid model based on $\\delta$-slack-based model\n($\\delta$-SBM) and ordinal priority approach (OPA) for measuring carbon\nemission efficiency driven by government policy preferences under data\nuncertainty. The proposed $\\delta$-SBM-OPA model incorporates constraints on\nthe importance of input and output variables under different policy preference\nscenarios. It then develops the efficiency optimization model with Farrell\nfrontiers and efficiency tapes to deal with the data uncertainty in input and\noutput variables. This study demonstrates the proposed model by analyzing\nindustrial carbon emission efficiency of Chinese provinces in 2021. It examines\nthe carbon emission efficiency and corresponding clustering results of\nprovinces under three types of policies: economic priority, environmental\npriority, and technological priority, with varying priority preferences. The\nresults indicate that the carbon emission efficiency of the 30 provinces can\nmainly be categorized into technology-driven, development-balanced, and\ntransition-potential types, with most provinces achieving optimal efficiency\nunder the technology-dominant preferences across all policy scenarios.\nUltimately, this study suggests a tailored roadmap and crucial initiatives for\ndifferent provinces to progressively and systematically work towards achieving\nthe low carbon goal.",

        "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in multi-agent simulators in the domain of\neconomic modeling. However, contemporary research often involves developing\nreinforcement learning (RL) based models that focus solely on a single type of\nagents, such as households, firms, or the government. Such an approach\noverlooks the adaptation of interacting agents thereby failing to capture the\ncomplexity of real-world economic systems. In this work, we consider a\nmulti-agent simulator comprised of RL agents of numerous types, including\nheterogeneous households, firm, central bank and government. In particular, we\nfocus on the crucial role of the government in distributing tax credits to\nhouseholds. We conduct two broad categories of comprehensive experiments\ndealing with the impact of tax credits on 1) households with varied degrees of\nmyopia (short-sightedness in spending and saving decisions), and 2) households\nwith diverse liquidity profiles. The first category of experiments examines the\nimpact of the frequency of tax credits (e.g. annual vs quarterly) on\nconsumption patterns of myopic households. The second category of experiments\nfocuses on the impact of varying tax credit distribution strategies on\nhouseholds with differing liquidities. We validate our simulation model by\nreproducing trends observed in real households upon receipt of unforeseen,\nuniform tax credits, as documented in a JPMorgan Chase report. Based on the\nresults of the latter, we propose an innovative tax credit distribution\nstrategy for the government to reduce inequality among households. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of this strategy in improving social welfare in our\nsimulation results.",

Here we develop and rigorously evaluate new\ndetection methods for issue framing and narrative analysis within large text\ndatasets. By introducing a novel application of next-token log probabilities\nderived from generative large language models (LLMs) we show that issue framing\ncan be reliably and efficiently detected in large corpora with only a few\nexamples of either perspective on a given issue, a method we call `paired\ncompletion'. Through 192 independent experiments over three novel, synthetic\ndatasets, we evaluate paired completion against prompt-based LLM methods and\nlabelled methods using traditional NLP and recent LLM contextual embeddings. We\nadditionally conduct a cost-based analysis to mark out the feasible set of\nperformant methods at production-level scales, and a model bias analysis.\nTogether, our work demonstrates a feasible path to scalable, accurate and\nlow-bias issue-framing in large corpora.",

Over the course of the\ntwentieth century, social evolutionary theory largely fell out of favor as a\nway of investigating human history, just as advances in complex systems science\nand computer science saw the emergence of powerful new conceptions of complex\nsystems, and in particular new methods of measuring complexity. We propose that\nthese advances in our understanding of complex systems and computer science\nshould be brought to bear on our investigations into human history. To that\nend, we present a new framework for modeling how human societies co-evolve with\ntheir biotic environments, recognizing that both a society and its environment\nare computers. This leads us to model the dynamics of each of those two systems\nusing the same, new kind of computational machine, which we define here. For\nsimplicity, we construe a society as a set of interacting occupations and\ntechnologies. Similarly, under such a model, a biotic environment is a set of\ninteracting distinct ecological and climatic processes. This provides novel\nways to characterize social complexity, which we hope will cast new light on\nthe archaeological and historical records. Our framework also provides a\nnatural way to formalize both the energetic (thermodynamic) costs required by a\nsociety as it runs, and the ways it can extract thermodynamic resources from\nthe environment in order to pay for those costs -- and perhaps to grow with any\nleft-over resources.",

        "abstract": "Online learning in a decentralized two-sided matching markets, where the\ndemand-side (players) compete to match with the supply-side (arms), has\nreceived substantial interest because it abstracts out the complex interactions\nin matching platforms (e.g. UpWork, TaskRabbit). However, past works assume\nthat each arm knows their preference ranking over the players (one-sided\nlearning), and each player aim to learn the preference over arms through\nsuccessive interactions. Moreover, several (impractical) assumptions on the\nproblem are usually made for theoretical tractability such as broadcast\nplayer-arm match Liu et al. (2020; 2021); Kong & Li (2023) or serial\ndictatorship Sankararaman et al. (2021); Basu et al. (2021); Ghosh et al.\n(2022). In this paper, we study a decentralized two-sided matching market,\nwhere we do not assume that the preference ranking over players are known to\nthe arms apriori. Furthermore, we do not have any structural assumptions on the\nproblem. We propose a multi-phase explore-then-commit type algorithm namely\nepoch-based CA-ETC (collision avoidance explore then commit) (\\texttt{CA-ETC}\nin short) for this problem that does not require any communication across\nagents (players and arms) and hence decentralized. We show that for the initial\nepoch length of $T_{\\circ}$ and subsequent epoch-lengths of $2^{l/\\gamma}\nT_{\\circ}$ (for the $l-$th epoch with $\\gamma \\in (0,1)$ as an input parameter\nto the algorithm), \\texttt{CA-ETC} yields a player optimal expected regret of\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(T_{\\circ} (\\frac{K \\log T}{T_{\\circ} \\Delta^2})^{1/\\gamma} +\nT_{\\circ} (\\frac{T}{T_{\\circ}})^\\gamma\\right)$ for the $i$-th player, where $T$\nis the learning horizon, $K$ is the number of arms and $\\Delta$ is an\nappropriately defined problem gap. Furthermore, we propose a blackboard\ncommunication based baseline achieving logarithmic regret in $T$.",

        "abstract": "As generative foundation models improve, they also tend to become more\npersuasive, raising concerns that AI automation will enable governments, firms,\nand other actors to manipulate beliefs with unprecedented scale and\neffectiveness at virtually no cost. The full economic and social ramifications\nof this trend have been difficult to foresee, however, given that we currently\nlack a complete theoretical understanding of why persuasion is costly for human\nlabor to produce in the first place. This paper places human and AI agents on a\ncommon conceptual footing by formalizing informational persuasion as a\nmathematical decision problem and characterizing its computational complexity.\nA novel proof establishes that persuasive messages are challenging to discover\n(NP-Hard) but easy to adopt if supplied by others (NP). This asymmetry helps\nexplain why people are susceptible to persuasion, even in contexts where all\nrelevant information is publicly available. The result also illuminates why\nlitigation, strategic communication, and other persuasion-oriented activities\nhave historically been so human capital intensive, and it provides a new\ntheoretical basis for studying how AI will impact various industries.",

        "abstract": "Understanding how people behave in strategic settings--where they make\ndecisions based on their expectations about the behavior of others--is a\nlong-standing problem in the behavioral sciences. We conduct the largest study\nto date of strategic decision-making in the context of initial play in\ntwo-player matrix games, analyzing over 90,000 human decisions across more than\n2,400 procedurally generated games that span a much wider space than previous\ndatasets. We show that a deep neural network trained on these data predicts\npeople's choices better than leading theories of strategic behavior, indicating\nthat there is systematic variation that is not explained by those theories. We\nthen modify the network to produce a new, interpretable behavioral model,\nrevealing what the original network learned about people: their ability to\noptimally respond and their capacity to reason about others are dependent on\nthe complexity of individual games. This context-dependence is critical in\nexplaining deviations from the rational Nash equilibrium, response times, and\nuncertainty in strategic decisions. More broadly, our results demonstrate how\nmachine learning can be applied beyond prediction to further help generate\nnovel explanations of complex human behavior.",

        "abstract": "In many situations people make sequences of similar, but unrelated decisions.\nSuch decision sequences are prevalent in many important contexts including\njudicial judgments, loan approvals, college admissions, and athletic\ncompetitions. A growing literature claims that decisions in such sequences may\nbe severely biased because decision outcomes seem to be systematically affected\nby the scheduling. In particular, it has been argued that mental depletion\nleads to harsher decisions before food breaks and that the ``law of small\nnumbers'' induces decisions to be negatively auto-correlated (i.e. favorable\ndecisions are followed by unfavorable ones and vice versa). These findings have\nattracted much academic and media attention and it has been suspected that they\nmay only represent the ``tip of the iceberg''. However, voices of caution point\nout that existing studies may suffer from serious limitations, because the\ndecision order is not randomly determined, other influencing factors are hard\nto exclude, or direct evidence for the underlying mechanisms is not available.\nWe exploit a large-scale natural experiment in a context in which the previous\nliterature would predict the presence of scheduling biases. Specifically, we\ninvestigate whether the grades of randomly scheduled oral exams in Law School\ndepend on the position of the exam in the sequence. Our rich data enables us to\nfilter-out student, professor, day, and course-specific features. Our results\ncontradict the previous findings and suggest that caution is advised when\ngeneralizing from previous studies for policy advice.",

The indicator is the minimum of the\nSahm indicator -- the difference between the 3-month trailing average of the\nunemployment rate and its minimum over the past 12 months -- and a similar\nindicator constructed with the vacancy rate -- the difference between the\n3-month trailing average of the vacancy rate and its maximum over the past 12\nmonths. We then propose a two-sided recession rule: When our indicator reaches\n0.3pp, a recession may have started; when the indicator reaches 0.8pp, a\nrecession has started for sure. This new rule is triggered earlier than the\nSahm rule: on average it detects recessions 0.8 month after they have started,\nwhile the Sahm rule detects them 2.1 months after their start. The new rule\nalso has a better historical track record: it perfectly identifies all\nrecessions since 1929, while the Sahm rule breaks down before 1960. With August\n2024 data, our indicator is at 0.54pp, so the probability that the US economy\nis now in recession is 48%. In fact, the recession may have started as early as\nMarch 2024.",

However, an issue of\nconcern has been always the fact that, as was shown in many publications, the\noptimal schedule in Mirrlees' paradigm of maximising the total utility\n(constructed from individually optimised individual ones) usually did not lead\nto progressive taxation (contradicting the ethically supported practice in\ndeveloped economies), and often even assigned minimal tax rates to the higher\npaid strata of society. The first objective of this paper is to support this\nconclusion by proving a theorem on optimal tax schedule in (practically most\nexploited) piecewise-linear environment under a simplest natural utility\nfunction. The second objective is to suggest a new paradigm for optimal\ntaxation, where instead of just total average utility maximization one\nintroduces a standard deviation of utility as a second parameter (in some\nanalogy with Marcowitz portfolio optimization). We show that this approach\nleads to transparent and easy interpreted optimality criteria for income tax.",

Additionally, combined multiple GPT ratings\non the same performance output show strong correlations with aggregated human\nperformance ratings, akin to the consensus principle observed in performance\nevaluation literature.

Lastly, in\nthe pre-Soviet-collapse period, which coincides with the time when democracy\npromotion was less often used as a justification for sanctions, the impact of\ndemocracy on GDP per capita is already weak or negative without any additional\ncontrols, and it becomes further negative once democratic favor is controlled.\nThese findings support the democratic favor channel and challenge the idea that\nthe institutional qualities of democracy per se lead to desirable outcomes.

        "abstract": "In real-world elections where voters cast preference ballots, voters often\nprovide only a partial ranking of the candidates. Despite this empirical\nreality, prior social choice literature frequently analyzes fairness criteria\nunder the assumption that all voters provide a complete ranking of the\ncandidates. We introduce new fairness criteria for multiwinner ranked-choice\nelections concerning truncated ballots. In particular, we define notions of the\nindependence of losing voters blocs and independence of winning voters blocs,\nwhich state that the winning committee of an election should not change when we\nremove partial ballots which rank only losing candidates, and the winning\ncommittee should change in reasonable ways when removing ballots which rank\nonly winning candidates. Of the voting methods we analyze, the\nChamberlin-Courant rule performs the best with respect to these criteria, the\nexpanding approvals rule performs the worst, and the method of single\ntransferable vote falls in between.",

Our study examines how two\nmajor types of viral channels, specifically Direct Messaging (DM) and\nBroadcasting (BC), impact the well-known \"strength of weak ties\" in\ndisseminating novel information across social networks. We conducted a\nlarge-scale empirical analysis, examining the sharing behavior of 500,000 users\nover a two-month period on a major social media platform. Our results suggest a\ngreater capacity for DM to transmit novel information compared to BC, although\nDM typically involves stronger ties. Furthermore, the \"strength of weak ties\"\nis only evident in BC, not in DM where weaker ties do not transmit\nsignificantly more novel information. Our mechanism analysis indicates that the\ncontent selection by both senders and recipients, contingent on tie strength,\ncontributes to the observed differences between these two channels. These\nfindings expand both our understanding of contemporary weak tie theory and our\nknowledge of how to disseminate novel information in social networks.",

The\nmajority of production is concentrated in the Axarqu\\'ia region in the south,\nwhere subtropical fruit plantations and associated water demands have steadily\nincreased over the last two decades. Between 2019-2024, the region underwent an\nextreme water crisis. Reservoir reserves became nearly depleted and groundwater\nlevels dropped to sea level in several locations, where seawater intrusion is\nlikely, causing large socioeconomic impacts including short-term harvest losses\nand a long-term loss in economic centrality. We examine the causal pathway that\nled to this crisis using a mixed-methods approach, combining data from key\ninformant interviews, an exhaustive review of legal documents, and quantitative\nanalysis of time series and spatially explicit data. In particular, we analyze\ndam water use for irrigation and urban use, meteorological data, reservoir and\ngroundwater levels, and irrigation land cover maps. Our findings show that an\nunusual meteorological drought was the immediate cause for the decline in\nreservoir and groundwater reserves (hydrological drought), but the underlying\ncause was a chronic and structural long-term imbalance between water demand and\nresources resulting from several structural governance shortcomings: large\nuncertainties in water resource availability and use hampering effective\nplanning, lack of enforcement of individual water quotas, and the absence of\nregulatory mechanisms to flexibly impose resource use restrictions at both\nmicro and macro levels based on the overall resources of the system.

        "abstract": "Accurate forecasts of the impact of spatial weather and pan-European\nsocio-economic and political risks on hourly electricity demand for the\nmid-term horizon are crucial for strategic decision-making amidst the inherent\nuncertainty. Most importantly, these forecasts are essential for the\noperational management of power plants, ensuring supply security and grid\nstability, and in guiding energy trading and investment decisions. The primary\nchallenge for this forecasting task lies in disentangling the multifaceted\ndrivers of load, which include national deterministic (daily, weekly, annual,\nand holiday patterns) and national stochastic weather and autoregressive\neffects. Additionally, transnational stochastic socio-economic and political\neffects add further complexity, in particular, due to their non-stationarity.\nTo address this challenge, we present an interpretable probabilistic mid-term\nforecasting model for the hourly load that captures, besides all deterministic\neffects, the various uncertainties in load. This model recognizes transnational\ndependencies across 24 European countries, with multivariate modeled\nsocio-economic and political states and cross-country dependent forecasting.\nBuilt from interpretable Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), the model enables\nan analysis of the transmission of each incorporated effect to the\nhour-specific load. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of countries\nreliant on electric heating under extreme weather scenarios. This emphasizes\nthe need for high-resolution forecasting of weather effects on pan-European\nelectricity consumption especially in anticipation of widespread electric\nheating adoption.",

        "abstract": "Studies looking at electricity market designs for very high shares of wind\nand solar often conclude that the energy-only market will break down. Without\nfuel costs, it is said that there is nothing to set prices. Symptoms of\nbreakdown include long phases of zero prices, scarcity prices too high to be\npolitically acceptable, prices that collapse under small perturbations of\ncapacities from the long-term equilibrium, cost recovery that is impossible due\nto low market values, high variability of revenue between different weather\nyears, and difficulty operating long-term storage with limited foresight. We\nargue that all these problems are an artefact of modeling with perfectly\ninelastic demand. If short-term elasticity to reflect today's flexible demand\n(-5%) is implemented in the model, these problems are significantly reduced.\nThe combined interaction of demand willingness to pay and storage opportunity\ncosts is enough to produce stable pricing. This behavior is illustrated by a\nmodel with wind, solar, batteries, and hydrogen-based storage, where a\npiecewise linear demand curve removes high price peaks and reduces the fraction\nof zero-price hours from 90% to around 30%, and entails more price stability\nfor perturbations of capacity and different weather years. Furthermore, we show\nthat with elastic demand, the long-term model exactly reproduces the prices of\nthe short-term model with the same capacities. We then use insights from the\nlong-term model to derive simple bidding strategies for storage so that we can\nalso run the short-term model with limited operational foresight. We\ndemonstrate this short-term operation in a model trained on 35 years of weather\ndata and tested on another 35 years of unseen data. We conclude that the\nenergy-only market can still play a key role in coordinating dispatch and\ninvestment in the future.",

To be eligible for federal funding, local\nhomelessness systems are required to implement assessment tools as part of\ntheir prioritization processes. The Vulnerability Index Service Prioritization\nDecision Assistance Tool (VI-SPDAT) is the most commonly used assessment tool\nnationwide. Recent studies have criticized the VI-SPDAT as exhibiting racial\nbias, which may lead to unwarranted racial disparities in housing provision. In\nresponse to these criticisms, some jurisdictions have developed alternative\ntools, such as the Allegheny Housing Assessment (AHA), which uses algorithms to\nassess clients' risk levels. Drawing on data from its deployment, we conduct\ndescriptive and quantitative analyses to evaluate whether replacing the\nVI-SPDAT with the AHA affects racial disparities in housing allocation. We find\nthat the VI-SPDAT tended to assign higher risk scores to white clients and\nlower risk scores to Black clients, and that white clients were served at a\nhigher rates pre-AHA deployment. While post-deployment service decisions became\nbetter aligned with the AHA score, and the distribution of AHA scores is\nsimilar across racial groups, we do not find evidence of a corresponding\ndecrease in disparities in service rates. We attribute the persistent disparity\nto the use of Alt-AHA, a survey-based tool that is used in cases of low data\nquality, as well as group differences in eligibility-related factors, such as\nchronic homelessness and veteran status. We discuss the implications for\nhousing service systems seeking to reduce racial disparities in their service\ndelivery.",

Using\nSeoul's credit card data from 2018 to 2023, we find a clear preference for\nshopping at amenities close to consumers' residences, particularly for trips\nwithin a 2 km radius, where relatedness density significantly influences\npurchasing decisions. The COVID-19 pandemic initially reduced this effect at\nshorter distances but rebounded in 2023, suggesting a resilient return to\npre-pandemic patterns, which vary over regions. Our findings highlight the\nresilience of local shopping preferences despite economic disruptions,\nunderscoring the importance of amenity-relatedness in urban consumer behavior.",

Given\nthe macroeconomic consequences of changes in unemployment benefits, including\ntheir impact on employment rates and output growth, we develop a closed\nmacroeconomic model that integrates heterogeneous households and adaptive firms\nand incorporates real-world entry-exit market mechanisms. The model considers\npersonal values, social norms, and social network formation among workers as we\nexamine the role of social contacts in mediating the effects of unemployment\nbenefits on job-matching quality and labour market outcomes. We simulate the\nmodel across various scenarios where unemployment benefit schemes differ in\nlevel and/or duration.

        "abstract": "The global transportation industry has become one of the main contributors to\nair pollution. Consequently, electric buses and green transportation are\ngaining popularity as crucial steps to reduce emission concerns. Many developed\ncountries have already adopted the concept of Battery Electric Buses (BEBs),\nwhile the developing ones are just starting with it. However, BEB fleets have\nadvantages, such as lower fuel, higher efficiency, lower maintenance, and\nenergy security. Yet, several obstacles must be overcome to support the mass\ndeployment of BEBs. These incorporate forthright expense charges, arranging\nloads, BEB reach, and newness to BEB innovation. Stakeholders like\npolicymakers, private company owners, and government leaders have a lot to\nconsider before introducing BEBs at any level in Pakistan. As a result, to\noperate an electric bus system profitably, it is crucial to develop a proper\nelectric bus network and fleet, especially for bus operators who need to buy\nenough electric buses at the appropriate time. As a result, this paper aims to\ninvestigate if operating an electric bus could be an alternative to regular bus\noperations. The proposed methodology develops modeling software to cater to\nvarious scenarios to determine a proper-designed electric bus operating system\nin terms of the electric bus route, service frequency, and quantity. This\nresearch work simulates and financially analyses an operating Public Transport\nInfrastructure with a proposed Green Solution. The results show that regardless\nof the high upfront costs of BEB infrastructure, it becomes profitable in 6-7\nyears, resulting in a decreased Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of approximately\n30% of its counterpart. The study also provides a clear policy pathway to help\nstakeholders make informed decisions related to the electrification of public\ntransport in Pakistan.",

Managers with higher\nworkloads report feeling lonely more frequently, and this relationship is\ndirect, as well as indirect because of less frequent social contacts. However,\nphysical isolation is not a significant predictor of loneliness. Moreover,\nshort food supply chains correlate with less frequent loneliness feelings.

Our model predicts\nfurther biodiversity decline under a business-as-usual scenario, primarily due\nto intensified land consolidation. We evaluate two policy options: reducing\npesticide use and subsidizing small farmers. While pesticide reduction rapidly\nbenefits biodiversity in the beginning, it eventually leads to increased land\nconsolidation and further biodiversity loss. In contrast, subsidizing small\nfarmers by reallocating a small fraction of existing subsidies, stabilizes farm\nsizes and enhances biodiversity in the long run. The most effective strategy\nresults from combining both policies, leveraging pesticide reduction alongside\ntargeted subsidies to balance economic pressures and consistently improve\nbiodiversity.",

These\nbusiness and regulatory challenges are particularly significant given the broad\nreach of AI, as well as the multiple uncertainties surrounding such\ntechnologies and their future development and effects. This article identifies\ntwo promising strategies for meeting the AI challenge, focusing on the example\nof Fintech. First, dynamic regulation, in the form of regulatory sandboxes and\nother regulatory approaches that aim to provide a space for responsible\nAI-related innovation. An empirical study provides preliminary evidence to\nsuggest that jurisdictions that adopt a more proactive approach to Fintech\nregulation can attract greater investment. The second strategy relates to\nso-called innovation ecosystems. It is argued that such ecosystems are most\neffective when they afford opportunities for creative partnerships between\nwell-established corporations and AI-focused startups and that this aspect of a\nsuccessful innovation ecosystem is often overlooked in the existing discussion.\nThe article suggests that these two strategies are interconnected, in that\ngreater investment is an important element in both fostering and signaling a\nwell-functioning innovation ecosystem and that a well-functioning ecosystem\nwill, in turn, attract more funding. The resulting synergies between these\nstrategies can, therefore, provide a jurisdiction with a competitive edge in\nbecoming a regional hub for AI-related activity.",

Therefore, attention heterogeneity driven\nby stockholdings can be a channel through which the distributional consequences\nof monetary policy are created.",

        "abstract": "Rural electrification initiatives worldwide frequently encounter financial\nplanning challenges due to a lack of reliable market insights. This research\ndelves into the preferences and marginal willingness to pay (mWTP) for upfront\nelectricity connections in rural and peri-urban areas of Nigeria. We\ninvestigate discrete choice experiment data gathered from 3,599 households and\n1,122 Small to Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) across three geopolitical zones\nof Nigeria, collected during the 2021 PeopleSuN project survey phase. Employing\nconditional logit modeling, we analyze this data to explore preferences and\nmarginal willingness to pay for electricity connection. Our findings show that\nhouseholds prioritize nighttime electricity access, while SMEs place a higher\nvalue on daytime electricity. When comparing improvements in electricity\ncapacity to medium or high-capacity, SMEs exhibit a sharp increase in\nwillingness to pay for high-capacity, while households value the two options\nmore evenly. Preferences for the electricity source vary among SMEs, but\nhouseholds display a reluctance towards diesel generators and a preference for\nthe grid or solar solutions. Moreover, households with older heads express\ngreater aversion to connection fees, and male-headed households show a stronger\npreference for nighttime electricity compared to their female-headed\ncounterparts. The outcomes of this study yield pivotal insights to tailor\nelectrification strategies for rural Nigeria, emphasizing the importance of\nconsidering the diverse preferences of households and SMEs.",

However, the short-run and long-run relationships\nbetween these variables have been interpreted in different ways, and many\ncontroversies are still open. Some authors have claimed that the causal\nrelationships between population health and income can be discovered using\ncointegration models. We show, however, that empirically testing a\ncointegration relation between LEB and GDP per capita is not a sound method to\ninfer a causal link between health and income. For a given country it is easy\nto find computer-generated data or time series of real observations, related or\nunrelated to the country, that according to standard methods are also\ncointegrated with the country's LEB. More generally, given a trending time\nseries, it is easy to find other series, observational or artificial, that\nappear cointegrated with it. Thus, standard cointegration methodology cannot\ndistinguish whether cointegration relationships are spurious or causal.",

Subsequently, we construct\ncounterfactuals for Zhoushan by selecting comparable cities from the dataset,\nexcluding Zhoushan, and applying a panel data approach. The difference between\nthe actual and counterfactual values for GDP growth rate and economic\nefficiency in Zhoushan is analyzed to determine the treatment effect of the\nNational New Area policy. The research reveals that in the initial four years,\nthe New Area policy enhanced Zhoushan's economic efficiency but negatively\naffected its GDP growth rate. This influence gradually disappeared after four\nyears. Further analysis suggests that the policy's effect on GDP growth rate\nvaries with the level of economic development in different regions, having a\nmore substantial impact in less developed areas. Therefore, we conclude that\nestablishing a New Area in relatively undeveloped zones is more advantageous.",

In light of this rapid progression, we pose and address a\ncentral question: to what extent must prompts evolve as the capabilities of\ngenerative AI models advance? To answer this question, we conducted an online\nexperiment with N = 1,893 participants where each participant was incentivized\nto write prompts to reproduce a target image as closely as possible in 10\nconsecutive tries. Each participant was randomly and blindly assigned to use\none of three text-to-image diffusion models: DALL-E 2, its more advanced\nsuccessor, DALL-E 3, or a version of DALL-E 3 with automatic prompt revision.\nIn total, we collected and analyzed over 18,000 prompts and over 300,000\nimages. We find that task performance was higher for participants using DALL-E\n3 than for those using DALL-E 2. This performance gap corresponds to a\nnoticeable difference in the similarity of participants' images to their target\nimages, and was caused in equal measure by: (1) the increased technical\ncapabilities of DALL-E 3, and (2) endogenous changes in participants' prompting\nin response to these increased capabilities. Furthermore, while participants\nassigned to DALL-E 3 with prompt revision still outperformed those assigned to\nDALL-E 2, automatic prompt revision reduced the benefits of using DALL-E 3 by\n58\\%. Our results suggest that for generative AI to realize its full impact on\nthe global economy, people, firms, and institutions will need to update their\nprompts in response to new models.

        "abstract": "Despite the growing importance of the digital sector, research on economic\ncomplexity and its implications continues to rely mostly on administrative\nrecords, e.g. data on exports, patents, and employment, that fail to capture\nthe nuances of the digital economy. In this paper we use data on the geography\nof programming languages used in open-source software projects to extend\neconomic complexity ideas to the digital economy. We estimate a country's\nsoftware economic complexity and show that it complements the ability of\nmeasures of complexity based on trade, patents, and research papers to account\nfor international differences in GDP per capita, income inequality, and\nemissions. We also show that open-source software follows the principle of\nrelatedness, meaning that a country's software entries and exits are explained\nby specialization in related programming languages. We conclude by exploring\nthe diversification and development of countries in open-source software in the\ncontext of large language models. Together, these findings help extend economic\ncomplexity methods and their policy considerations to the digital sector.",

        "abstract": "Remote sensing map products are used to obtain estimates of environmental\nquantities, such as deforested area or the effect of conservation zones on\ndeforestation. However, the quality of map products varies, and - because maps\nare outputs of complex machine learning algorithms that take in a variety of\nremotely sensed variables as inputs - errors are difficult to characterize.\nThus, population-level estimates from such maps may be biased. In this paper,\nwe compare several uncertainty quantification methods - stratified estimator,\npost-stratified estimator, and prediction-powered inference - that combine a\nsmall amount of randomly sampled ground truth data with large-scale remote\nsensing map products to generate unbiased estimates. Applying these methods\nacross four remote sensing use cases in area and regression coefficient\nestimation, we find that they result in estimates that are more reliable than\nusing the map product as if it were 100% accurate and have lower uncertainty\nthan using only the ground truth and ignoring the map product.\nPrediction-powered inference uses ground truth data to correct for bias in the\nmap product estimate and (unlike stratification) does not require us to choose\na map product before sampling. This is the first work to (1) apply\nprediction-powered inference to remote sensing estimation tasks, and (2)\nperform uncertainty quantification on remote sensing regression coefficients\nwithout assumptions on the structure of map product errors. To improve the\nutility of machine learning-generated remote sensing maps for downstream\napplications, we recommend that map producers provide a randomly sampled\nholdout ground truth dataset to be used for calibration in uncertainty\nquantification alongside their maps.

In this paper, we provide an alternative formulation of the\nprincipal-agent problem, which can be solved simply by relying on the theory of\nBSDEs. This reformulation is strongly inspired by an important remark in [9],\nnamely that if the principal observes the output process in continuous-time,\nshe can compute its quadratic variation pathwise. While in [9], this\ninformation is used in the contract, our reformulation consists in assuming\nthat the principal could directly control this process, in a `first-best'\nfashion. The resolution approach for this alternative problem actually follows\nthe line of the so-called `Sannikov's trick' in the literature on\ncontinuous-time principal-agent problems, as originally introduced by Sannikov\n(2008) [28]. We then show that the solution to this `first-best' formulation is\nidentical to the solution of the original problem. More precisely, using the\ncontract form introduced in [9] as `penalisation contracts', we highlight that\nthis `first-best' scenario can be achieved even if the principal cannot\ndirectly control the quadratic variation. Nevertheless, we do not have to rely\non the theory of 2BSDEs to prove that such contracts are optimal, as their\noptimality is ensured by showing that the `first-best' scenario is achieved. We\nbelieve that this more straightforward approach to solve continuous-time\nprincipal-agent problems with volatility control will facilitate the\ndissemination of these problems across many fields, and its extension to even\nmore intricate problems.",

        "abstract": "Herding behavior has become a familiar phenomenon to investors, carrying the\npotential danger of both undervaluing and overvaluing assets, while also\nthreatening market stability. This study contributes to the literature on\nherding behavior by using a more recent dataset to cover the most impactful\nevents of recent years. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining\nherding behavior across three different types of investment vehicle.\nFurthermore, this is also the first study observing herding at a community\n(subset) level. Specifically, we first explore this phenomenon in each separate\ntype of investment vehicle, namely stocks, US ETFs and cryptocurrencies, using\nthe widely recognized Cross Sectional Absolute Deviation (CSAD) model. We find\nsimilar herding patterns between stocks and US ETFs, while these traditional\nassets reveal a distinction from cryptocurrencies. Subsequently, the same\nexperiment is implemented on a combination of all three investment vehicle\ntypes. For a deeper investigation, we adopt graph-based techniques such as\nMinimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Louvain community detection to partition the\ngiven combination into smaller subsets whose assets are most similar to each\nother, then seek to detect the herding behavior on each subset. We find that\nherding behavior exists at all times across all types of investment vehicle at\na subset level, although the herding might not manifest at the superset level.\nAdditionally, this herding behavior tends to stem from specific events that\nsolely impact that subset of assets. Given these findings, investors can\nconstruct an appropriate investment strategy composed of their choice of\ninvestment vehicles they are interested in.",

On the other hand, the extensive margin shows product\nchurning due to the treaty beyond regular entry-exit dynamics: one product in\neight that was not previously exported substitutes almost as many that are no\nlonger exported. When we delve into the heterogeneity, we find that the effects\nof the treaty are higher for products at a comparative advantage. Focusing on\nmultiproduct firms, we find that they adjust their portfolio in Canada by\nreallocating towards their first and most exported product due to increasing\nlocal market competition after trade liberalization. Finally, multidimensional\ncounterfactuals allow us to evaluate the general equilibrium effect of the\nCETA. Specifically, we observe trade diversion, as exports to other\ndestinations are re-directed to Canada.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the adoption of a green ammonia economy in meeting\nchallenges in China's sustainable development. First, key challenges in China's\nenergy transition, industry decarbonziation and regional sustainable\ndevelopment are explored. The coal-dominated energy consumption has placed\ngreat obstacles in achieving energy transition and led to massive CO2 emission\nsince the large-scale industrialization. The high dependency on oil and gas\nimport has threatened the energy security. A DEA model is applied for obtaining\ngreen total factor productivities of China's six administrative regions, with\nwhich, imbalanced and unsustainable regional development is identified. Second,\nthe role of green ammonia in meeting the sustainability challenges is analysed.\nAmmonia is examined to be a flexible and economic option for large-scale\nhydrogen transport and storage. Co-firing ammonia in coal power generation at\n3% rate is evaluated as an option for achieving low-carbon transition by 2030.\nThe adoption of a green ammonia economy in China is discussed from energy,\nenvironmental and economic aspects. The practice can decline fossil energy\nconsumption, enhance energy security, and facilitate renewable energy delivery\nand storage, industry decarbonization, and regional development. We assume the\nfindings and results contribute to addressing sustainability challenges and\nrealizing a hydrogen economy in China.",

We use a novel systematic modeling scheme that\nprioritizes health-related criteria as hard constraints and optimizes cost and\npreference-related criteria as part of the objective function. We present a\nmixed-integer linear program formulation, along with a nested branch-and-price\ntechnique. Results from a case study in Austin, Texas demonstrate that\ninstances of realistic size can be solved to optimality within reasonable\nruntimes. The price of robustness primarily results from reduced patient load\nper caregiver.

        "abstract": "We study firms' strategic interactions when each firm may own multiple\nproduction technologies, each with its own marginal cost and capacity.\nIncreasing industry concentration by reallocating non-efficient capacity to the\nlargest and most efficient firm can decrease market prices as it incentivizes\nthe firm to outcompete its rivals. However, with large reallocations, the\nstandard monotonic relationship between concentration and prices re-emerges as\ncompetition weakens due to the rival's lower capacity. Thus, we demonstrate a\nU-shaped relationship between market prices and industry concentration when\nfirms are diversified. This result does not rely on economies of scale or\nscope. We find consistent evidence from the Colombian wholesale energy market,\nwhere strategic firms are diversified with fossil-fuel and renewable\ntechnologies, exploiting exogenous variation in renewable capacities. Our\nfindings not only apply to the green transition but also to other industries\nand suggest new insights for antitrust policies.",

        "abstract": "How does the presence of an AI assistant affect the collective attention of a\nteam? We study 20 human teams of 3-4 individuals paired with one voice-only AI\nassistant during a challenging puzzle task. Teams are randomly assigned to an\nAI assistant with a human- or robotic-sounding voice that provides either\nhelpful or misleading information about the task. Treating each individual AI\ninterjection as a treatment intervention, we identify the causal effects of the\nAI on dynamic group processes involving language use. Our findings demonstrate\nthat the AI significantly affects what teams discuss, how they discuss it, and\nthe alignment of their mental models. Teams adopt AI-introduced language for\nboth terms directly related to the task and for peripheral terms, even when\nthey (a) recognize the unhelpful nature of the AI, (b) do not consider the AI a\ngenuine team member, and (c) do not trust the AI. The process of language\nadaptation appears to be automatic, despite doubts about the AI's competence.\nThe presence of an AI assistant significantly impacts team collective attention\nby modulating various aspects of shared cognition. This study contributes to\nhuman-AI teaming research by highlighting collective attention as a central\nmechanism through which AI systems in team settings influence team performance.\nUnderstanding this mechanism will help CSCW researchers design AI systems that\nenhance team collective intelligence by optimizing collective attention.",

        "abstract": "The Latin American region has suffered an economic slowdown since the end of\nthe commodities boom. Within this context, Chile was the poster child of\neconomic growth and development up until 2014. Since then, Chile has also been\ntrapped in a decade of slow economic growth. Chile's sudden slowdown and recent\ngrowth path divergence have posed a puzzle for economic growth and development\neconomics. This paper examines this slowdown from an empirical perspective and\ndetermines how much can be attributed to internal and external causes. Using a\nsynthetic control approach and a structural time series Bayesian estimation,\nour findings suggest that at least two-thirds of the Chilean slowdown is\nattributable to internal causes driven by a policy regime change in 2014, with\nexternal factors playing a secondary role. The net effect of this set of\ninternal reforms resulted in a nearly 10% reduction in real GDP per capita over\nfive years and led to a 1.8% decline in average GDP growth rates from 2015 to\n2019. Our results are consistent with the literature that establishes that\nexternal shocks can explain only a small fraction of the poor economic\nperformance of developing countries, suggesting that internal factors are the\nprimary source of subpar performance. This research sheds light on the\npotential effects of policy regime shifts in economic growth, thus providing\nvaluable insights for development economics and, more specifically, emerging\neconomies.",

        "abstract": "China is the leading crop producer and has successfully implemented\nsustainable development programs related to agriculture. Sustainable\nagriculture has been promoted to achieve national food security targets such as\nfood self-sufficiency through the well-facilitated farmland construction (WFFC)\napproach. The WFFC is introduced in Chinas current national 10-year plan to\nconsolidate farmlands into large and simplified production areas to maximise\nautomation, and improve soil fertility and productivity. However, research\nsuggests that diversified and smaller farms faciliate ecosystem services, can\nimprove yield resilience, defuse human health threats, and increase farm\nprofitability. Currently, WFFC has not considered ecological farmland\nimprovements and it may miss long-term environmental benefits including\necosystem service preservation conducive to yields. Moreover, the nutritional\nstatus in China has changed in recent decades with undernutrition being\ndramatically reduced, but the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and chronic\ndiseases being increased. While a strategic choice and management of crop and\nlivestock species can improve nutrition, the environmental and production\nbenefits of agricultural diversification are currently not well interlinked\nwith Chinas food and nutrition security discussions. Lastly, the role of\nagricultural technology for socioeconomic benefits and the link with\ndiversified agricultural production may provide vast benefits for food\nsecurity. Here, we focus on the opportunities and co-benefits of agricultural\ndiversification and technology innovations to advance food and nutrition\nsecurity in China through ecosystem service and yield benefits. Our applied\nfive-point research agenda can provide evidence-based opportunities to support\nChina in reaching its ambitious food security targets through agricultural\ndiversification with global ramifications.",

Experiments on one-to-one\nadvice suggest that communication between peers usually benefits accuracy,\nwhile group experiments indicate that communication networks produce highly\nvariable outcomes. Notably, it is possible for a group's average estimate to\nbecome less accurate even as its individual group members -- on average --\nbecome more accurate. However, the conditions under which communication\nimproves group and/or individual outcomes remain poorly characterised. We\nanalyse an empirically supported model of opinion formation to derive these\nconditions, formally explicating the relationship between group-level effects\nand individual outcomes. We reanalyze previously published experimental data,\nfinding that empirical dynamics are consistent with theoretical expectations.\nWe show that 3 measures completely describe asymptotic opinion dynamics: the\ninitial crowd bias; the degree of influence centralisation; and the correlation\nbetween influence and initial biases. We find analytic expressions for the\nchange in crowd and individual accuracy as a function of the product of these\nthree measures, which we describe as the truth alignment. We show how truth\nalignment can be decomposed into calibration (influence/accuracy correlation),\nand herding (influence/averageness correlation), and how these measures relate\nto changes in accuracy.

In this article, we\nuse double machine learning to examine the heterogeneous causal effect of\ncredit ratings on leverage. Taking advantage of the flexibility of random\nforests within the double machine learning framework, we model the relationship\nbetween variables associated with leverage and credit ratings without imposing\nstrong assumptions about their functional form. This approach also allows for\ndata-driven variable selection from a large set of individual company\ncharacteristics, supporting valid causal inference. We report three findings:\nFirst, credit ratings causally affect the leverage ratio. Having a rating, as\nopposed to having none, increases leverage by approximately 7 to 9 percentage\npoints, or 30\\% to 40\\% relative to the sample mean leverage. However, this\nresult comes with an important caveat, captured in our second finding: the\neffect is highly heterogeneous and varies depending on the specific rating. For\nAAA and AA ratings, the effect is negative, reducing leverage by about 5\npercentage points. For A and BBB ratings, the effect is approximately zero.\nFrom BB ratings onwards, the effect becomes positive, exceeding 10 percentage\npoints. Third, contrary to what the second finding might imply at first glance,\nthe change from no effect to a positive effect does not occur abruptly at the\nboundary between investment and speculative grade ratings. Rather, it is\ngradual, taking place across the granular rating notches (\"+/-\") within the BBB\nand BB categories.",

        "abstract": "The thesis of a capitalist road to communism (van der Veen and Van Parijs,\n1986) asserts that Marx realm of freedom can be reached from within welfare\ncapitalism, skipping socialism, by using a tax-financed unconditional basic\nincome until it is close to disposable income per head, so that the very\ndistinction between paid work and free time is cancelled as a result. We\nrevisit and update this thesis for two reasons: the recent prospect of a\npost-labor society following the automation revolution in technology, and that\nwelfare capitalism has become more inegalitarian and less hospitable to basic\nincome. We use a simple economic model which incorporates an upward adjustment\nof basic income to labor-saving technical change and distinguishes between\ncapital that complements labor and capital that is fully substitutable with\nlabor. A baseline simulation of the model shows the economic feasibility of a\ncapitalist transition to communism. Two versions of a scenario incorporating\ninterplay between technical change and market socialist institutional reforms\nare set out which make the transition politically viable to some extent,\ndepending on the social distribution of power over technology. The most\npromising version is one in which the productivity of labor and automation\ncapital grow at similar rates. We show in which respects it approximates the\nideal of communism. One finding is that communism does not require reaching the\nfinal stage of a post-labor society. We conclude with a reflection on the\nrelevance of our present update for the more immediate future of unconditional\nbasic income.",

        "abstract": "In response to the negative environmental, social, and economic externalities\nof the dominant food model, a consensus is emerging on the need to develop\nalternative food systems capable of facilitating a transition to a more\nsustainable model. Among these alternatives, short food supply chains (SFSCs)\nare identified as potential crucibles of alternativity. Defined as distribution\nchannels with a maximum of one intermediary between producer and consumer,\nSFSCs can contribute to the reterritorialization of food flows and the creation\nof relational and geographical proximities among food chain actors. This study\nexamines how logistical engagement translates into the choice of SFSC points of\nsale by consumers and farmers. It evaluates this engagement through the travel\ntimes farmers and consumers are willing to endure to sell or buy at an SFSC\npoint of sale, and the prices they are willing to accept or pay for SFSC\nproducts. A discrete choice experiment conducted in 2022 with 154 farm managers\nand 1022 consumers analyzed preferences regarding types of points of sale,\nsales prices, travel times, and relational proximity. The results show that\nconsumers engaged in SFSCs favour alternative points of sale such as farms and\nassociations, even for longer travel times. Farmers also value these points of\nsale, with logistical engagement more pronounced among those already marketing\nthrough SFSCs. Supermarkets appear less attractive to alternative profiles but\nserve as entry points for new participants in SFSCs. Relational proximity\nbetween farmers and consumers is important, with a preference for direct\nexchanges during sales. This study highlights the importance of actor\nengagement in SFSCs and offers perspectives for developing alternative\nlogistics by valuing relational proximity and using conventional points of sale\nas entry points for new actors in the SFSCs.",

The Economic and Product Complexity Indices,\nintroduced as an attempt to measure these capabilities from a country's basket\nof exported products, have become popular to study economic development, the\ngeography of innovation, and industrial policies. Despite this reception, the\ninterpretation of these indicators proved difficult. Although the original\nMethod of Reflections suggested a direct interconnection between country and\nproduct metrics, it has been proved that the Economic and Product Complexity\nIndices result from a spectral clustering algorithm that separately groups\nsimilar countries or similar products, respectively. This recent approach to\neconomic and product complexity conflicts with the original one and treats\nseparately countries and products. However, building on previous\ninterpretations of the indices and the recent evolution in spectral clustering,\nwe show that these indices simultaneously identify two co-clusters of similar\ncountries and products. This viewpoint reconciles the spectral clustering\ninterpretation of the indices with the original Method of Reflections\ninterpretation. By proving the often neglected intimate relationship between\ncountry and product complexity, this approach emphasizes the role of a selected\nset of products in determining economic development while extending the range\nof applications of these indicators in economics.",

An often proposed explanation specifically distinguishes between the\nopposite effect of realized and unrealized losses on risk preferences.\nMoreover, higher-order risk preferences and its relation to post-disaster\nbehaviors remain unexplored, despite potential theoretical implications. We\naddress these gaps in the literature by conducting experiments with 600\nindividuals post Turkeys 2023 catastrophic earthquake, specifically heavily\naffected individuals who are displaced, those who are not and a control group.\nResults indicate higher risk-taking in heavily affected individuals when\ncompared to unaffected individuals. Our results are specifically driven by\naffected females. We find no pre existing differences in risk preferences\nbetween earthquake and control areas using 2012 data. Within the heavily\naffected group of individuals, higher house damage, our proxy for realized\nlosses, increases risk aversion. Regarding higher-order risk preferences for\nindividuals heavily affected by the earthquake, we find that prudence is\npositively associated with selfprotective behaviors after the earthquake,\nspecifically internal migration and/or displacement. While precautionary\nsavings shows initially no correlation to prudence, a positive association\nemerges when considering that prudence is also related to occupational choices,\nwith individuals with stable incomes and who save being more prudent.

The program has created $13 billion in\ndirect payments to generators annually since 2015 and is now being implemented\nor considered in several major energy markets in the US and abroad. We assess\nthe incentive's impact on the Texas market from three perspectives: First, we\nderive the incentive's equilibrium effect on the electricity price in a\nmonopolistic market from first principles using a standard partial equilibrium\neconomic model. We then empirically test whether the incentive encouraged net\nentry into the market or the generating applicant pool, controlling for market\nand climatic conditions using monthly capacity data. Finally, we look for\ndirect evidence of an incentive response among active traders using real-time\nmarket trading data. The three approaches suggest buyers and producers cancel\nout the incentive, and the price-only program does not encourage new generation\ncapacity to enter the market.",

While bilateral negotiations can lead to\nexcessive compensation due to asymmetric information, a competitive auction can\ndiscover the true cost of closure and help allocate funds more efficiently and\ntransparently. Since Germany is the only country till date to have implemented\na coal phaseout auction, we use it to analyse the merits and demerits of the\npolicy, drawing comparisons with other countries that have phased out coal\nthrough other means. The German experience with coal phaseout auctions\nillustrates the necessity of considering additionality and interaction with\nexisting climate policies, managing dynamic incentives, and evaluating impacts\non security of supply. While theoretically auctions have attractive properties,\nin practice, their design must address these concerns to unlock the full\nbenefits.

To address this, with the development of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), some researchers have recently attempted to develop\nsimulated economic experiments using LLMs-driven agents, called generative\nagents. If generative agents can replicate human-like decision-making in\neconomic experiments, the cost problem of economic experiments can be\nalleviated. However, such a simulation framework has not been yet established.\nConsidering the previous research and the current evolutionary stage of LLMs,\nthis study focuses on the reasoning ability of generative agents as a key\nfactor toward establishing a framework for such a new methodology. A\nmulti-agent simulation, designed to improve the reasoning ability of generative\nagents through prompting methods, was developed to reproduce the result of an\nactual economic experiment on the ultimatum game. The results demonstrated that\nthe higher the reasoning ability of the agents, the closer the results were to\nthe theoretical solution than to the real experimental result. The results also\nsuggest that setting the personas of the generative agents may be important for\nreproducing the results of real economic experiments. These findings are\nvaluable for the future definition of a framework for replacing human\nparticipants with generative agents in economic experiments when LLMs are\nfurther developed.",

        "abstract": "Digitalization is a core component of the green transition. Today's focus is\non quantifying and pre-dicting the climate effects of digitalization through\nvarious life-cycle assessments and baseline sce-nario methodologies. Here we\nargue that this is a mistake. Most attempts at prediction are based on three\nimplicit assumptions: (a) the digital carbon footprint can be quantified, (b)\nbusiness-as-usual with episodic change leading to a new era of stability, and\n(c) investments in digitalization will be delivered within the cost, timeframe,\nand benefits described in their business cases. We problema-tize each\nassumption within the context of digitalization and argue that the digital\ncarbon footprint is inherently unpredictable. We build on uncertainty\nliterature to show that even if you cannot predict, you can still mitigate. On\nthat basis, we propose to rethink practice on the digital carbon footprint from\nprediction to mitigation.",

Historians argue that newswires played a\npivotal role in creating a national identity and shared understanding of the\nworld, but there is no comprehensive archive of the content sent over\nnewswires. We reconstruct such an archive by applying a customized deep\nlearning pipeline to hundreds of terabytes of raw image scans from thousands of\nlocal newspapers. The resulting dataset contains 2.7 million unique public\ndomain U.S. newswire articles, written between 1878 and 1977. Locations in\nthese articles are georeferenced, topics are tagged using customized neural\ntopic classification, named entities are recognized, and individuals are\ndisambiguated to Wikipedia using a novel entity disambiguation model. To\nconstruct the Newswire dataset, we first recognize newspaper layouts and\ntranscribe around 138 millions structured article texts from raw image scans.\nWe then use a customized neural bi-encoder model to de-duplicate reproduced\narticles, in the presence of considerable abridgement and noise, quantifying\nhow widely each article was reproduced. A text classifier is used to ensure\nthat we only include newswire articles, which historically are in the public\ndomain. The structured data that accompany the texts provide rich information\nabout the who (disambiguated individuals), what (topics), and where\n(georeferencing) of the news that millions of Americans read over the course of\na century. We also include Library of Congress metadata information about the\nnewspapers that ran the articles on their front pages.

Consequently, China\nand the US are on track to reach an equal number of team leaders engaged in\nbilateral collaborations between 2027 and 2028. Nevertheless, Chinese progress\nhas been considerably slower in per-collaborator terms: after adjusting for the\nnumber of non-leaders from each country, our models do not predict parity\nbetween the US and China until after 2087. These dynamics extend to 11 critical\ntechnology areas central to ongoing diplomacy between the two nations, such AI,\nSemiconductors, and Advanced Communications, and to China's scientific\nleadership with respect to the European Union and the United Kingdom.

In this\nmodel, observing an agent fail an easy task is highly diagnostic of a low\nability, making them unlikely to succeed at any harder task. Conversely, a\nsuccess on a hard task makes successes on any easier task likely. We\nexperimentally show that humans project this model onto AI. Both prior beliefs\nand belief updating about AI performance on standardized math questions appear\nconsistent with the human ability model. This contrasts with actual AI\nperformance, which is uncorrelated with human difficulty in our context, and\nmakes such beliefs misspecified. Embedding our framework into an adoption\nmodel, we show that patterns of under- and over-adoption can be sustained in an\nequilibrium with anthropomorphic beliefs.",

Therefore, a food accessibility evaluation\nindex is proposed in this work to quantify how well nutrition needs are met.\nThe proposed index is then embedded in a stochastic multi-objective\nmixed-integer optimization problem to determine the optimal supply chain design\nto maximize food accessibility and minimize cost. Considering uncertainty in\ndemand and supply, the multi-objective problem is solved in a two-phase\nsimulation-optimization framework in which Green Field Analysis is applied to\ndetermine the long-term, tactical decisions such as supply chain configuration,\nand then Monte Carlo simulation is performed iteratively to determine the\nshort-term supply chain operations by solving a stochastic programming problem.\nA case study is conducted on the beef supply chain in Qatar. Pareto efficient\nsolutions are validated in discrete event simulation to evaluate the\nperformance of the designed supply chain in various realistic scenarios and\nprovide recommendations for different decision-makers.",

Results indicate that among the\ntested feature selection strategies, the variance method, edit distance, and\nHausdorff methods exhibit the least sensitivity to changes in data volume.\nThese methods therefore provide a dependable approach to reducing feature space\nwithout significantly compromising the predictive accuracy.

However, this effect was short-lived, with slant returning to its\npre-ban levels within two weeks post-enforcement. Additionally, we find a\ndetectable albeit less pronounced indirect effect on users who had not directly\ninteracted with the outlets before the ban. We provide evidence that other\nsuppliers of propaganda may have actively sought to mitigate the ban's\ninfluence by intensifying their activity, effectively counteracting the\npersistence and reach of the ban.",

This has sparked debate on whether pricing algorithms may\ntacitly collude to set supra-competitive prices without being explicitly\ndesigned to do so. Our study addresses these concerns by examining the risk of\ncollusion when Reinforcement Learning algorithms are used to decide on pricing\nstrategies in competitive markets. Prior research in this field focused on\nTabular Q-learning (TQL) and led to opposing views on whether learning-based\nalgorithms can lead to supra-competitive prices. Our work contributes to this\nongoing discussion by providing a more nuanced numerical study that goes beyond\nTQL by additionally capturing off- and on-policy Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(DRL) algorithms. We study multiple Bertrand oligopoly variants and show that\nalgorithmic collusion depends on the algorithm used. In our experiments, TQL\nexhibits higher collusion and price dispersion phenomena compared to DRL\nalgorithms. We show that the severity of collusion depends not only on the\nalgorithm used but also on the characteristics of the market environment. We\nfurther find that Proximal Policy Optimization appears to be less sensitive to\ncollusive outcomes compared to other state-of-the-art DRL algorithms.",

It remains unclear to what extent sustainability has been integrated\ninto accounting and controlling, and what competencies employees need to manage\nthis transformation. These questions will be critically analyzed in this\nstructured literature review of 79 publications. The results provide insights\ninto a) how companies conceptualize sustainability, b) whether and how they\nintegrate it into their value creation processes, and c) the relevance of\naccounting and controlling for these developments.

        "abstract": "This paper examines the alignment of inductive biases in machine learning\n(ML) with structural models of economic dynamics. Unlike dynamical systems\nfound in physical and life sciences, economics models are often specified by\ndifferential equations with a mixture of easy-to-enforce initial conditions and\nhard-to-enforce infinite horizon boundary conditions (e.g. transversality and\nno-ponzi-scheme conditions). Traditional methods for enforcing these\nconstraints are computationally expensive and unstable. We investigate\nalgorithms where those infinite horizon constraints are ignored, simply\ntraining unregularized kernel machines and neural networks to obey the\ndifferential equations. Despite the inherent underspecification of this\napproach, our findings reveal that the inductive biases of these ML models\ninnately enforce the infinite-horizon conditions necessary for the\nwell-posedness. We theoretically demonstrate that (approximate or exact)\nmin-norm ML solutions to interpolation problems are sufficient conditions for\nthese infinite-horizon boundary conditions in a wide class of problems. We then\nprovide empirical evidence that deep learning and ridgeless kernel methods are\nnot only theoretically sound with respect to economic assumptions, but may even\ndominate classic algorithms in low to medium dimensions. More importantly,\nthese results give confidence that, despite solving seemingly ill-posed\nproblems, there are reasons to trust the plethora of black-box ML algorithms\nused by economists to solve previously intractable, high-dimensional dynamical\nsystems -- paving the way for future work on estimation of inverse problems\nwith embedded optimal control problems.",

We document that the Games remain costly and continue to have\nlarge cost overruns, to a degree that threatens their viability. The IOC is\naware of the problem and has initiated reform. We assess the reforms and find:\n(a) Olympic costs are statistically significantly increasing; prior analysis\ndid not show this trend; it is a step in the wrong direction. (b) Cost overruns\nwere decreasing until 2008, but have increased since then; again a step in the\nwrong direction. (c) At present, the cost of Paris 2024 is USD 8.7 billion\n(2022 level) and cost overruns is 115% in real terms; this is not the cheap\nGames that were promised. (d) Cost overruns are the norm for the Games, past,\npresent, and future; they are the only project type that never delivered on\nbudget. We assess a new IOC policy of reducing cost by reusing existing venues\ninstead of building new ones. We find that reuse did not have the desired\neffect for Tokyo 2020 and also look ineffective for Paris 2024. Finally, we\nrecommend that the Games look to other types of megaprojects for better data,\nbetter forecasting, and how to generate the positive learning curves that are\nnecessary for bringing costs and overrun down. Only if this happens are Los\nAngeles 2028 and Brisbane 2032 likely to live up to the IOC's intentions of a\nmore affordable Games that more cities will want to host.",

With escalating\natmospheric CO2 levels, the imperative of direct air capture (DAC) systems\nbecomes evident. Simultaneously, green hydrogen (GH) emerges as a pivotal\nmedium for renewable energy. Nevertheless, the substantial expenses associated\nwith these technologies impede widespread adoption, primarily due to\nsignificant installation costs and underutilized operational advantages when\ndeployed independently. Integration through sector coupling enhances system\nefficiency and sustainability, while shared power sources and energy storage\ndevices offer additional economic benefits. In this study, we assess the\neconomic viability of polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzers versus\nalkaline electrolyzers within the context of sector coupling. Our findings\nindicate that combining GH production with solid DAC systems yields significant\neconomic advantages, with approximately a 10% improvement for PEM electrolyzers\nand a 20% enhancement for alkaline electrolyzers.

        "abstract": "In airport operations, optimally using dedicated personnel for baggage\nhandling tasks plays a crucial role in the design of resource-efficient\nprocesses. Teams of workers with different qualifications must be formed, and\nloading or unloading tasks must be assigned to them. Each task has a time\nwindow within which it can be started and should be finished. Violating these\ntemporal restrictions incurs severe financial penalties for the operator. In\npractice, various components of this process are subject to uncertainties. We\nconsider the aforementioned problem under the assumption of stochastic travel\ntimes across the apron. We present two binary program formulations to model the\nproblem at hand and solve it with a Branch-Price-Cut-and-Switch approach, in\nwhich we dynamically switch between two master problem formulations.\nFurthermore, we use an exact separation method to identify violated rank-1\nChv\\'atal-Gomory cuts and utilize an efficient branching rule relying on task\nfinish times. We test the algorithm on instances generated based on real-world\ndata from a major European hub airport with a planning horizon of up to two\nhours, 30 flights per hour, and three available task execution modes to choose\nfrom. Our results indicate that our algorithm is able to significantly\noutperform existing solution approaches. Moreover, an explicit consideration of\nstochastic travel times allows for solutions that utilize the available\nworkforce more efficiently, while simultaneously guaranteeing a stable service\nlevel for the baggage handling operator.",

The study finds a significant gap in diffusion rates between\nthe two groups, but current trends indicate it is narrowing. China is\nidentified as a crucial future source of AI diffusion through value chains,\nwhile the USA is more influential in research and knowledge transfers. The\npaper's limitations include the omission of additional data sources and\ncountries, and the lack of investigation into the relationship between\ndiffusion and technology intensity. Nonetheless, it raises salient macro-level\nquestions about AI diffusion and suggests emphasis on redistribution mechanisms\nof AI induced economic gains, and bilateral agreements as a complement to\ninternational accords, to address diverse needs and corresponding risks faced\nby economies transitioning into an AI-dominated era. Additionally, it\nhighlights the need for research into the links between AI diffusion,\ntechnology intensity, and productivity; case studies combined with targeted\npolicy recommendations; more accurate methods for measuring AI diffusion; and a\ndeeper investigation into its labor market impacts particular to LMICs.",

LLMs, can not only compose textual\nscripts such as emails and essays but also executable programming code.\nContrary, the automated reasoning capability of these LLMs in performing\nstatistically-driven descriptive analysis, particularly on user-specific data\nand as personal assistants to users with limited background knowledge in an\napplication domain who would like to carry out basic, as well as advanced\nstatistical and domain-specific analysis is not yet fully explored. More\nimportantly, the performance of these LLMs has not been compared and discussed\nin detail when domain-specific data analysis tasks are needed. This study,\nconsequently, explores whether LLMs can be used as generative AI-based personal\nassistants to users with minimal background knowledge in an application domain\ninfer key data insights. To demonstrate the performance of the LLMs, the study\nreports a case study through which descriptive statistical analysis, as well as\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) based investigations, are performed on a\nnumber of phishing emails with the objective of comparing the accuracy of the\nresults generated by LLMs to the ones produced by analysts.

        "abstract": "The observed similarities in the behavior of humans and Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have prompted researchers to consider the potential of using LLMs as\nmodels of human cognition. However, several significant challenges must be\naddressed before LLMs can be legitimately regarded as cognitive models. For\ninstance, LLMs are trained on far more data than humans typically encounter,\nand may have been directly trained on human data in specific cognitive tasks or\naligned with human preferences. Consequently, the origins of these behavioral\nsimilarities are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a novel way to\nenhance the utility of LLMs as cognitive models. This approach involves (i)\nleveraging computationally equivalent tasks that both an LLM and a rational\nagent need to master for solving a cognitive problem and (ii) examining the\nspecific task distributions required for an LLM to exhibit human-like\nbehaviors. We apply this approach to decision-making -- specifically risky and\nintertemporal choice -- where the key computationally equivalent task is the\narithmetic of expected value calculations. We show that an LLM pretrained on an\necologically valid arithmetic dataset, which we call Arithmetic-GPT, predicts\nhuman behavior better than many traditional cognitive models. Pretraining LLMs\non ecologically valid arithmetic datasets is sufficient to produce a strong\ncorrespondence between these models and human decision-making. Our results also\nsuggest that LLMs used as cognitive models should be carefully investigated via\nablation studies of the pretraining data.",

        "abstract": "Debt recycling is an aggressive equity extraction strategy that potentially\npermits faster repayment of a mortgage. While equity progressively builds up as\nthe mortgage is repaid monthly, mortgage holders may obtain another loan they\ncould use to invest on a risky asset. The wealth produced by a successful\ninvestment is then used to repay the mortgage faster. The strategy is riskier\nthan a standard repayment plan since fluctuations in the house market and\ninvestment's volatility may also lead to a fast default, as both the mortgage\nand the liquidity loan are secured against the same good. The general\nconditions of the mortgage holder and the outside market under which debt\nrecycling may be recommended or discouraged have not been fully investigated.\nIn this paper, to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional monthly mortgage\nrepayment versus debt recycling strategies, we build a dynamical model of debt\nrecycling and study the time evolution of equity and mortgage balance as a\nfunction of loan-to-value ratio, house market performance, and return of the\nrisky investment. We find that the model has a rich behavior as a function of\nits main parameters, showing strongly and weakly successful phases - where the\nmortgage is eventually repaid faster and slower than the standard monthly\nrepayment strategy, respectively - a default phase where the equity locked in\nthe house vanishes before the mortgage is repaid, signalling a failure of the\ndebt recycling strategy, and a permanent re-mortgaging phase - where further\ninvestment funds from the lender are continuously secured, but the mortgage is\nnever fully repaid. The strategy's effectiveness is found to be highly\nsensitive to the initial mortgage-to-equity ratio, the monthly amount of\nscheduled repayments, and the economic parameters at the outset. The analytical\nresults are corroborated with numerical simulations with excellent agreement.",

        "abstract": "With companies, states, and countries targeting net-zero emissions around\nmidcentury, there are questions about how these targets alter household welfare\nand finances, including distributional effects across income groups. This paper\nexamines the distributional dimensions of technology transitions and net-zero\npolicies with a focus on welfare impacts across household incomes. The analysis\nuses a model intercomparison with a range of energy-economy models using\nharmonized policy scenarios reaching economy-wide, net-zero CO2 emissions\nacross the United States in 2050. We employ a novel linking approach that\nconnects output from detailed energy system models with survey microdata on\nenergy expenditures across income classes to provide distributional analysis of\nnet-zero policies. Although there are differences in model structure and input\nassumptions, we find broad agreement in qualitative trends in policy incidence\nand energy burdens across income groups. Models generally agree that direct\nenergy expenditures for many households will likely decline over time with\nreference and net-zero policies. However, there is variation in the extent of\nchanges relative to current levels, energy burdens relative to reference\nlevels, and electricity expenditures. Policy design, primarily how climate\npolicy revenues are used, has first-order impacts on distributional outcomes.\nNet-zero policy costs, in both absolute and relative terms, are unevenly\ndistributed across households, and relative increases in energy expenditures\nare higher for lowest-income households. However, we also find that recycled\nrevenues from climate policies have countervailing effects when rebated on a\nper-capita basis, offsetting higher energy burdens and potentially even leading\nto net progressive outcomes.",

Here we examine the role of generative AI in enhancing\nor replacing traditional team dynamics using a randomized controlled experiment\nwith 435 participants across 122 teams. We show that teams augmented with\ngenerative AI significantly outperformed those relying solely on human\ncollaboration across various performance measures. Interestingly, teams with\nmultiple AIs did not exhibit further gains, indicating diminishing returns with\nincreased AI integration. Our analysis suggests that centralized AI usage by a\nfew team members is more effective than distributed engagement. Additionally,\nindividual-AI pairs matched the performance of conventional teams, suggesting a\nreduced need for traditional team structures in some contexts. However, despite\nthis capability, individual-AI pairs still fell short of the performance levels\nachieved by AI-assisted teams. These findings underscore that while generative\nAI can replace some traditional team functions, more comprehensively\nintegrating AI within team structures provides superior benefits, enhancing\noverall effectiveness beyond individual efforts.",

While numerous models\neffectively predict short-term (hours to a few days) hourly load, mid-term\nforecasting solutions remain scarce. In mid-term load forecasting, besides\ndaily, weekly, and annual seasonal and autoregressive effects, capturing\nweather and holiday effects, as well as socio-economic non-stationarities in\nthe data, poses significant modeling challenges. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a novel forecasting method using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)\nbuilt from interpretable P-splines and enhanced with autoregressive\npost-processing. This model uses smoothed temperatures, Error-Trend-Seasonal\n(ETS) modeled non-stationary states, a nuanced representation of holiday\neffects with weekday variations, and seasonal information as input. The\nproposed model is evaluated on load data from 24 European countries. This\nanalysis demonstrates that the model not only has significantly enhanced\nforecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods but also offers\nvaluable insights into the influence of individual components on predicted\nload, given its full interpretability. Achieving performance akin to day-ahead\nTSO forecasts in fast computation times of a few seconds for several years of\nhourly data underscores the model's potential for practical application in the\npower system industry.",

The findings\nconfirm a significant relationship between multimarket contact and reduced\nprice differences, indicating collusive equilibria facilitated by frequent\ninteractions across markets. Moreover, the results highlight that airlines\nexhibit more collusive behavior when pricing non-stop flights, and are more\nlikely to attain tacit collusion when they approaches duopoly in a particular\nmarket. The study also explores the effects of airline mergers on collusion,\nemploying an event study methodology with a difference-in-difference (DID)\ndesign. It finds no direct evidence that mergers lead to increased collusion\namong unmerged carriers. However, it reveals that during and after the merger\nprocess, carrier pairs between merged and unmerged carriers are more likely to\ncollude compared to pairs of unmerged carriers.",

        "abstract": "The digital age has significantly changed how music is consumed, promoted,\nand monetized. Social media platforms like TikTok are playing a pivotal role in\nthis transformation. This shift has sparked a debate within the music industry:\nWhile some stakeholders see social media platforms like TikTok as opportunities\nto boost songs to viral status, others raise concerns about potential\ncannibalization effects, fearing that such exposure might reduce revenue from\nstreaming services like Spotify. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of a\nsong's presence - or absence - on social media on its demand on music streaming\nservices using a quasi-natural experiment: Universal Music Group's (UMG) - one\nof \"The Big 3\" record labels - decision to remove its entire content library\nfrom TikTok in February 2024. We use representative samples covering close to\n50% of the US and 94% of the German streaming markets, employing a\ndifference-in-differences approach to compare the streaming consumption of\nsongs that were removed from TikTok with those that were not. We find that\nUMG's removal of music from TikTok led to a 2-3% increase in streams on audio\nplatforms for affected songs, indicating substitution effects. However, this\naverage treatment effect masks significant heterogeneity: older songs and songs\nwith less promotional support elsewhere saw a decrease in streaming\nconsumption, suggesting that TikTok helps consumers discover or rediscover\ncontent that is not top of mind for consumers.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the economic and security implications of Proof-of-Stake\n(POS) designs, providing a survey of POS design choices and their underlying\neconomic principles in prominent POS-blockchains. The paper argues that\nPOS-blockchains are essentially platforms that connect three groups of agents:\nusers, validators, and investors. To meet the needs of these groups,\nblockchains must balance trade-offs between security, user adoption, and\ninvestment into the protocol. We focus on the security aspect and identify two\ndifferent strategies: increasing the quality of validators (static security)\nvs. increasing the quantity of stakes (dynamic security). We argue that quality\ncomes at the cost of quantity, identifying a trade-off between the two\nstrategies when designing POS systems. We test our qualitative findings using\npanel analysis on collected data. The analysis indicates that enhancing the\nquality of the validator set through security measures like slashing and\nminimum staking amounts may decrease dynamic security. Further, the analysis\nreveals a strategic divergence among blockchains, highlighting the absence of a\nsingle, universally optimal staking design solution. The optimal design hinges\nupon a platform's specific objectives and its developmental stage. This\nresearch compels blockchain developers to meticulously assess the trade-offs\noutlined in this paper when developing their staking designs.",

Our analysis reveals issues such\nas unclear application of data filters, inconsistent variable treatment, and\nerroneous statistical conclusions. The Report suggests that the EJRA increased\njob creation rates at Cambridge, but we show Cambridge consistently had lower\njob creation rates for Established Academic Careers compared to other Russell\nGroup universities, both before and after EJRA implementation in 2011, with no\nevidence for a significant change in this deficit post implementation. This\nsuggests that EJRA is not a significant factor driving job creation rates.\nSince other universities without an EJRA exhibit higher job creation rates,\nthis suggests job creation can be sustained without such a policy. We conclude\nthat the EJRA did not achieve its intended goal of increasing opportunities for\nyoung academics and may have exacerbated existing disparities compared to other\nleading universities. We recommend EJRA be abolished at Cambridge since it does\nnot meet its aims and could be viewed as unlawful age discrimination.\\newline\n\\it{This version is a revision reflecting some of the comments made by members\nof the university EJRA review group in public discussion, see \\cite{Holmes24}.}",

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used in various applications,\nfrom recommendation systems in e-commerce to diagnosis prediction in\nhealthcare. In this paper, we present a novel dynamic framework for thinking\nabout the deployment of ML models in a performative, human-ML collaborative\nsystem. In our framework, the introduction of ML recommendations changes the\ndata-generating process of human decisions, which are only a proxy to the\nground truth and which are then used to train future versions of the model. We\nshow that this dynamic process in principle can converge to different stable\npoints, i.e. where the ML model and the Human+ML system have the same\nperformance. Some of these stable points are suboptimal with respect to the\nactual ground truth. As a proof of concept, we conduct an empirical user study\nwith 1,408 participants. In the study, humans solve instances of the knapsack\nproblem with the help of machine learning predictions of varying performance.\nThis is an ideal setting because we can identify the actual ground truth, and\nevaluate the performance of human decisions supported by ML recommendations. We\nfind that for many levels of ML performance, humans can improve upon the ML\npredictions. We also find that the improvement could be even higher if humans\nrationally followed the ML recommendations. Finally, we test whether monetary\nincentives can increase the quality of human decisions, but we fail to find any\npositive effect. Using our empirical data to approximate our collaborative\nsystem suggests that the learning process would dynamically reach an\nequilibrium performance that is around 92% of the maximum knapsack value. Our\nresults have practical implications for the deployment of ML models in contexts\nwhere human decisions may deviate from the indisputable ground truth.",

To this end, we present a novel approach that couples\nthe dynamic model of capital, consumption, and utility in macroeconomics with\nthe interaction model of joint business and redistribution in econophysics.\nWith this approach, we calculate the capital (wealth), the utility based on\nconsumption, and the Gini index of these inequality using redistribution and\nconsumption thresholds as moral parameters. The results show that:\nunder-redistribution and waste exacerbate inequality; conversely,\nover-redistribution and stinginess reduce utility; and a balanced moderate\nmoral leads to achieve both reduced inequality and increased utility. These\nfindings provide renewed economic and numerical support for the moral\nimportance known from philosophy, anthropology, and religion. The revival of\nredistribution and consumption morals should promote the transformation to a\nhuman mutual-aid economy, as indicated by philosopher and anthropologist,\ninstead of the capitalist economy that has produced the current inequality. The\npractical challenge is to implement bottom-up social business, on a foothold of\nworker coops and platform cooperatives as a community against the state and the\nmarket, with moral consensus and its operation.",

Natural disasters could have\nsignificant economic effects, especially in developing economies. This is\nparticularly important for highly seismic countries such as Chile and New\nZealand. This paper contributes to the literature on natural disasters and\neconomic development by analyzing the cases of two affected regions within\nthese countries in the wake of major earthquakes experienced during 2010-2011:\nMaule (Chile) and Canterbury (New Zealand). We examine the impact of natural\ndisasters on GDP per capita by applying the synthetic control method. Using the\nsynthetic approach, we assess the effects of these two earthquakes by building\ncounterfactuals to compare their recovery trajectories. We find that Chile and\nNew Zealand experienced opposite economic effects. The Canterbury region grew\n10% more in three years than its synthetic counterfactual without the\nearthquake, while the Maule region declined by 5%. We build synthetic controls\nat a regional and economic-sector level, looking at aggregated and sectoral\neffects.

        "abstract": "Claims of soft-handed prosecutorial policies and increases in crime were\nprecipitating factors in the removal of Chesa Boudin as district attorney of\nthe city and county of San Francisco. However, little research has been\nconducted to empirically investigate the veracity of these indictments on the\nformer district attorney. Using regression discontinuity design (RDD), I find\nthat the Boudin administration led to a 36\\% and 21\\% reduction in monthly\nprosecutions and convictions respectively for all crimes. Moreover, his tenure\nincreased monthly successful case diversions by 58\\%. When only looking at\nviolent crimes during this period, the SFDA's office saw a 36\\% decrease, 7\\%\ndecrease, and 47\\% increase in monthly prosecutions, convictions, and\nsuccessful case diversions respectively. Although, the decrease in monthly\nconvictions was not statistically significant for the violent crimes subset.\nAdditionally, I did identify a potentially causal relationship between lower\nnumbers of prosecutions and higher levels of criminal activity, however, such\nfindings did not meet the standard for statistical significance. Finally, I\nconclude that using machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks and\nK-nearest neighbors, in place of ordinary least squares regression for the\nestimation of the reduced form equation possibly may decrease the size of the\nstandard errors of the parameters in the structural equation. However, future\nresearch needs to be conducted in this space to corroborate these initially\npromising findings.",

Such branded recommerce is\nincreasingly platform-enabled, creating opportunities for greater\nsustainability and stronger brand experience control but posing a greater risk\nof cannibalization of the sales of new items. We model the effects that the\nsales of pre-owned items have on market segmentation and product durability\nchoices for a monopolist facing heterogeneous customers, contrasting outcomes\nwhen the trade of pre-owned goods takes place through a third-party marketplace\nwith outcomes under branded recommerce. We show that the direct revenue\nbenefits of branded recommerce are not their primary source of value to the\nmonopolist, and rather, there are three indirect effects that alter profits and\nsustainability. Product durability increases, a seller finds it optimal to\nforgo marketplace fees altogether, and there are greater seller incentives to\nlower the quality uncertainty associated with pre-owned items. We establish\nthese results for a simple two-period model as well as developing a new\ninfinite horizon model with overlapping generations.

        "abstract": "In a series of precedent papers, we have presented a comprehensive\nmethodology, termed Field Economics, for translating a standard economic model\ninto a statistical field-formalism framework. This formalism requires a large\nnumber of heterogeneous agents, possibly of different types. It reveals the\nemergence of collective states among these agents or type of agents while\npreserving the interactions and microeconomic features of the system at the\nindividual level. In two prior papers, we applied this formalism to analyze the\ndynamics of capital allocation and accumulation in a simple microeconomic\nframework of investors and firms.Building upon our prior work, the present\npaper refines the initial model by expanding its scope. Instead of considering\nfinancial firms investing solely in real sectors, we now suppose that financial\nagents may also invest in other financial firms. We also introduce banks in the\nsystem that act as investors with a credit multiplier. Two types of interaction\nare now considered within the financial sector: financial agents can lend\ncapital to, or choose to buy shares of, other financial firms. Capital now\nflows between financial agents and is only partly invested in real sectors,\ndepending on their relative returns. We translate this framework into our\nformalism and study the diffusion of capital and possible defaults in the\nsystem, both at the macro and micro level.At the macro level, we find that\nseveral collective states may emerge, each characterized by a distinct level of\naverage capital and investors per sector. These collective states depend on\nexternal parameters such as level of connections between investors or firms'\nproductivity.The multiplicity of possible collective states is the consequence\nof the nature of the system composed of interconnected heterogeneous agents.\nSeveral equivalent patterns of returns and portfolio allocation may emerge. The\nmultiple collective states induce the unstable nature of financial markets, and\nsome of them include defaults may emerge. At the micro level, we study the\npropagation of returns and defaults within a given collective state. Our\nfindings highlight the significant role of banks, which can either stabilize\nthe system through lending activities or propagate instability through loans to\ninvestors.",

Repealing ASC-CON laws causes a continuous increase in ASCs per\ncapita, an effect which levels off ten years after repeal. Contrary to the\n'cream-skimming' hypothesis, we find no evidence that CON repeal is associated\nwith hospital closures in rural areas. Rather, some regression models show that\nrepeal is associated with fewer medical service reductions.",

This study is the first to adopt a bottom-up model to measure the\nreal-world energy use and carbon dioxide emissions of China's top twenty\nselling PHEV models across different regions from 2020 to 2022. The results\nindicate that (1) the actual electricity intensity of the best-selling PHEV\nmodels (20.2-38.2 kWh/100 km) was 30-40% higher than the New European Driving\nCycle values, and the actual gasoline intensity (4.7-23.5 L/100 km) was 3-6\ntimes greater than the New European Driving Cycle values. (2) The overall\nenergy use of the best-selling models varied among different regions, and the\nenergy use from 2020 to 2022 in Southern China was double that Northern China\nand the Yangtze River Middle Reach. (3) The top-selling models emitted 4.7\nmegatons of carbon dioxide nationwide from 2020 to 2022, with 1.9 megatons\nreleased by electricity consumption and 2.8 megatons released by gasoline\ncombustion. Furthermore, targeted policy implications for expediting the\ncarbon-neutral transition within the passenger car sector are proposed. In\nessence, this study explores and compares benchmark data at both the national\nand regional levels, along with performance metrics associated with PHEV\noperations.

We find that the gender\nconviction-rate gap for domestic violence cases is significantly larger than\nthe same gap for other misdemeanor cases (3 p.p. larger) and for other physical\nassault cases (8 p.p. larger). Furthermore, we find evidence that at least two\nchannels explain this gender conviction-rate gap for domestic violence cases:\ngender-based differences in evidence interpretation and gender-based sentencing\ncriteria. Lastly, we find that this gender conviction rate has no significant\nimpact on the probability of appeals, ruling reversals or recidivism.",

We propose an agent-based\nmodel accounting for the whole production side of the economy to unfold the\nproduction process from its very beginning, when firms receive production\norders, to the delivery of the products to the market. In the model we analyze\nwith a high-degree of details how heterogeneous firms, having labor and capital\nas productive factors, behave along all the realization processes of their\noutputs. The main focus covers: i) the heterogeneous duration of firms'\nproduction processes, ii) the adaptive strategies they implement to adjust\ntheir choices, and iii) the possible failures which may occur due to the\nduration of the production. Our agent-based model is a controlled experiment:\nwe use a virtual central planner mechanism, which acts as the demand side of\nthe economy, to observe which firm individual behaviors and aggregate\nmacroeconomic outcomes emerge as a reply to its different behaviors in a\nceteris paribus environment. Our applied goal, then, is to discuss the role of\nindustrial policy by modeling production processes in detail.",

        "abstract": "Strong local clusters help firms compete on global markets. One explanation\nfor this is that firms benefit from locating close to their suppliers and\ncustomers. However, the emergence of global supply chains shows that physical\nproximity is not necessarily a prerequisite to successfully manage\ncustomer-supplier relations anymore. This raises the question when firms need\nto colocate in value chains and when they can coordinate over longer distances.\nWe hypothesize that one important aspect is the extent to which supply chain\npartners exchange not just goods but also know-how. To test this, we build on\nan expanding literature that studies the drivers of industrial coagglomeration\nto analyze when supply chain connections lead firms to colocation. We exploit\ndetailed micro-data for the Hungarian economy between 2015 and 2017, linking\nfirm registries, employer-employee matched data and firm-to-firm transaction\ndata from value-added tax records. This allows us to observe colocation, labor\nflows and value chain connections at the level of firms, as well as construct\naggregated coagglomeration patterns, skill relatedness and input-output\nconnections between pairs of industries. We show that supply chains are more\nlikely to support coagglomeration when the industries involved are also skill\nrelated. That is, input-output and labor market channels reinforce each other,\nbut supplier connections only matter for colocation when industries have\nsimilar labor requirements, suggesting that they employ similar types of\nknow-how. We corroborate this finding by analyzing the interactions between\nfirms, showing that supplier relations are more geographically constrained\nbetween companies that operate in skill related industries.",

The fair representation is explored by comparing the networks of\npanellists based on their co-authorship relations, the networks based on\njournals in which they published and the networks based on their affiliated\ninstitutions (universities, research centres and newspapers). The results show\nthat the members of the first two panels had connections much higher than the\nmembers of the control group.

        "abstract": "Many experimental studies report that economics students tend to act more\nselfishly than students of other disciplines, a finding that received\nwidespread public and professional attention. Two main explanations that the\nexisting literature offers for the differences found in the behavior between\neconomists and noneconomists are the selection effect, and the indoctrination\neffect. We offer an alternative, novel explanation. We argue that these\ndifferences can be explained by differences in the interpretation of the\ncontext. We test this hypothesis by conducting two social dilemma experiments\nin the US and Israel with participants from both economics and non-economics\nmajors. In the experiments, participants face a tradeoff between profit\nmaximization, that is the market norm and workers welfare, that is the social\nnorm. We use priming to manipulate the cues that the participants receive\nbefore they make their decision. We find that when participants receive cues\nsignaling that the decision has an economic context, both economics and\nnon-economics students tend to maximize profits. When the participants receive\ncues emphasizing social norms, on the other hand, both economics and\nnon-economics students are less likely to maximize profits. We conclude that\nsome of the differences found between the decisions of economics and\nnon-economics students can be explained by contextual cues.",

We aim to\nunderstand the potential consequences of deeply uncertain systemic events on\nthe supply chain resilience and how does the information precision affect\nindividual agents' choices and the chain-level preparedness to aggregate\nshocks. Augmenting a parsimonious supply chain model with uncertainty, we\nanalyse the relationship between the upstream sourcing decisions and the supply\nchain survival probability. Both risk-averse and ambiguity-averse\nindividually-optimising agents' upstream sourcing paths are efficient but can\nbecome vulnerable to aggregate shocks. In contrast, a chain-level coordination\nof downstream firm sourcing decisions can qualitatively improve the robustness\nof the entire supply chain compared to the individual decision-making baseline.\nSuch a robust decision making ensures that in the presence of an aggregate\nshock - independently of its realisation - part of upstream suppliers will\nsurvive and the final goods' supply will be ensured even under the most\ndemanding circumstances. Our results also indicate that an input source\ndiversification extracts a cost in foregone efficiency.",

Static analysis shows a decrease in\nconnectedness with higher moments, while dynamic analysis highlights increased\nsensitivity to event-driven shocks. We find that both tight and loose monetary\npolicy shocks initially elevate connectedness within the first six months.\nHowever, the effects of tight shocks gradually fade, whereas loose shocks may\nreduce connectedness after one year.

        "abstract": "Agent-based models (ABMs) are simulation models used in economics to overcome\nsome of the limitations of traditional frameworks based on general equilibrium\nassumptions. However, agents within an ABM follow predetermined 'bounded\nrational' behavioural rules which can be cumbersome to design and difficult to\njustify. Here we leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) to expand the\ncapabilities of ABMs with the introduction of 'fully rational' agents that\nlearn their policy by interacting with the environment and maximising a reward\nfunction. Specifically, we propose a 'Rational macro ABM' (R-MABM) framework by\nextending a paradigmatic macro ABM from the economic literature. We show that\ngradually substituting ABM firms in the model with RL agents, trained to\nmaximise profits, allows for studying the impact of rationality on the economy.\nWe find that RL agents spontaneously learn three distinct strategies for\nmaximising profits, with the optimal strategy depending on the level of market\ncompetition and rationality. We also find that RL agents with independent\npolicies, and without the ability to communicate with each other, spontaneously\nlearn to segregate into different strategic groups, thus increasing market\npower and overall profits. Finally, we find that a higher number of rational\n(RL) agents in the economy always improves the macroeconomic environment as\nmeasured by total output. Depending on the specific rational policy, this can\ncome at the cost of higher instability. Our R-MABM framework allows for stable\nmulti-agent learning, is available in open source, and represents a principled\nand robust direction to extend economic simulators.",

One year after the\nintervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of approximately 40,000\nexperimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment\ngroup were 6\\% more likely to report new employment within a year, with an 8\\%\nincrease in jobs related to their certificates. This effect was more pronounced\namong LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.

The LATE estimates are imprecise but large in\nmagnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles the baseline\nprobability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the optimal transaction fee mechanisms for blockchains,\nfocusing on the distinction between price-based ($\\mathcal{P}$) and\nquantity-based ($\\mathcal{Q}$) controls. By analyzing factors such as demand\nuncertainty, validator costs, cryptocurrency price fluctuations, price\nelasticity of demand, and levels of decentralization, we establish criteria\nthat determine the selection of transaction fee mechanisms. We present a model\nframed around a Nash bargaining game, exploring how blockchain designers and\nvalidators negotiate fee structures to balance network welfare with\nprofitability. Our findings suggest that the choice between $\\mathcal{P}$ and\n$\\mathcal{Q}$ mechanisms depends critically on the blockchain's specific\ntechnical and economic features. The study concludes that no single mechanism\nsuits all contexts and highlights the potential for hybrid approaches that\nadaptively combine features of both $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$ to meet\nvarying demands and market conditions.",

        "abstract": "A growing share of the world's population is being born via assisted\nreproductive technology (ART), including in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). However,\ntwo concerns persist. First, ART pregnancies correlate with predictors of poor\noutcomes at birth--and it is unclear whether this relationship is causal.\nSecond, the emotional and financial costs associated with ART-use might\nexacerbate defensive medical behaviour, where physicians intervene more than\nnecessary to reduce the risk of adverse medical outcomes and litigation. We\naddress the challenge of identifying the pure effect of ART-use on both\nmaternal and infant outcomes at birth by leveraging exogenous variation in the\nsuccess of ART cycles. We compare the obstetric outcomes for ART-conceived\nbirths with those of spontaneously-conceived births after a failed ART\ntreatment. Moreover, we flexibly adjust for key confounders using double\nmachine learning. We do this using clinical registry ART data and\nadministrative maternal and infant data from New South Wales (NSW) between\n2009-2017. We find that ART slightly decreases the risk of obstetric\ninterventions, lowering the risk of a caesarean section and increasing the rate\nof spontaneous labour (+3.5 p.p.). Moreover, we find that ART has a\nstatistically and clinically insignificant effect on infant health outcomes.\n  Keywords: Fertility, Assisted reproduction, IVF, Caesarean Section,\nObstetric, Infertility.

Our\nmodel considers two distinct types of investors in financial markets: noise\ntraders and fundamentalists. Financial states evolve via probabilistic dynamics\nthat include economic strategies with local and global influences. The local\nmajoritarian opinion drives noise traders' market behavior, while the market\nindex influences the financial decisions of fundamentalist agents. We introduce\na level of market anxiety $q$ present in the decision-making process that\ninfluences financial action. In our investigation, nodes of a complex network\nrepresent market agents, whereas the links represent their financial\ninteractions. We investigate the stochastic dynamics of the model on three\ndistinct network topologies, including scale-free networks, small-world\nnetworks and Erd{\\\"o}s-R\\'enyi random graphs. Our model mirrors various traits\nobserved in real-world financial return series, such as heavy-tailed return\ndistributions, volatility clustering, and short-term memory correlation of\nreturns. The histograms of returns are fitted by coupled Gaussian\ndistributions, quantitatively revealing transitions from a leptokurtic to a\nmesokurtic regime under specific economic heterogeneity. We show that the\nmarket dynamics depend mainly on the average agent connectivity, anxiety level,\nand market composition rather than on specific features of network topology.",

Contrary to previous\nstudies that primarily focus on high-value minerals and their political\noutcomes resulted from substantial economic revenues, this study investigates\ncobalt's influence on local conflict. Despite its strategic importance,\ncobalt's limited commercial value presents a unique yet critical case for\nanalysis. Different with the prevailing view that links mineral reserves with\nincreased conflict, this research finds that regions rich in cobalt experience\na reduction in conflict. This decrease is attributed to enhanced government\nsecurity measures, which are implemented independently of the economic benefits\nderived from cobalt as a commodity. The study utilizes a combination of\ngeoreferenced data and a difference-in-difference design to analyze the causal\nrelationship between cobalt deposits and regional conflict. The findings\nsuggest that the presence of cobalt deposits leads to enhanced security\ninterventions by governments, effectively reducing the likelihood of\nnon-governmental actors taking control of these territories.

        "abstract": "Software vulnerabilities enable exploitation by malicious hackers,\ncompromising systems and data security. This paper examines bug bounty programs\n(BBPs) that incentivize ethical hackers to discover and responsibly disclose\nvulnerabilities to software vendors. Using game-theoretic models, we capture\nthe strategic interactions between software vendors, ethical hackers, and\nmalicious hackers. First, our analysis shows that software vendors can increase\nexpected profits by participating in BBPs, explaining their growing adoption\nand the success of BBP platforms. Second, we find that vendors with BBPs will\nrelease software earlier, albeit with more potential vulnerabilities, as BBPs\nenable coordinated vulnerability disclosure and mitigation. Third, the optimal\nnumber of ethical hackers to invite to a BBP depends solely on the expected\nnumber of malicious hackers seeking exploitation. This optimal number of\nethical hackers is lower than but increases with the expected malicious hacker\ncount. Finally, higher bounties incentivize ethical hackers to exert more\neffort, thereby increasing the probability that they will discover severe\nvulnerabilities first while reducing the success probability of malicious\nhackers. These findings highlight BBPs' potential benefits for vendors beyond\nprofitability. Earlier software releases are enabled by managing risks through\ncoordinated disclosure. As cybersecurity threats evolve, BBP adoption will\nlikely gain momentum, providing vendors with a valuable tool for enhancing\nsecurity posture and stakeholder trust. Moreover, BBPs envelop vulnerability\nidentification and disclosure into new market relationships and transactions,\nimpacting software vendors' incentives regarding product security choices like\nrelease timing.",

        "abstract": "Based on the quarterly data from 26 advanced economies (AEs) and 18 emerging\nmarket economies (EMs) over the past two decades, this paper estimates the\nshort- and medium-term impacts of financial cycles on the duration and\namplitude of public debt cycles. The results indicate that public debt\nexpansions are larger than their contractions in duration and amplitude,\naligning with the \"deficit bias hypothesis\" and being more pronounced in EMs\nthan in AEs. The impacts of various financial cycles are different.\nSpecifically, credit cycles in EMs significantly impact the duration and\namplitude of public debt cycles. Notably, short- and medium-term credit booms\nin EMs shorten the duration of public debt contractions and reduce the\namplitude. Fast credit growth in AEs prolongs the duration of public debt\nexpansions and increases the amplitude. However, credit cycles in AEs show no\nsignificant impact. For house price cycles, the overall impact is stronger in\nEMs than in AEs, differing between short- and medium-term cycles. Finally, the\nimpact of equity price cycles is significant in the short term, but not in the\nmedium term. Equity price busts are more likely to prolong the expansion of\npublic debt in EMs while increasing the amplitude of public debt contractions\nin AEs. Uncovering the impacts of multiple financial cycles on public debt\ncycles provides implications for better debt policies under different financial\nconditions.",

This paradigm\nshift raises questions about the traditional reliance on centralized trust and\nintroduces a novel, decentralized trust framework built upon distributed\nnetworks. Our research delves into the consequences of this shift, particularly\nfocusing on how incidents influence trust within cryptocurrency markets,\nthereby affecting trade behaviors in centralized (CEXs) and decentralized\nexchanges (DEXs). We conduct a comprehensive analysis of various events,\nassessing their effects on market dynamics, including token valuation and\ntrading volumes in both CEXs and DEXs. Our findings highlight the pivotal role\nof trust in directing user preferences and the fluidity of trust transfer\nbetween centralized and decentralized platforms. Despite certain anomalies, the\nresults largely align with our initial hypotheses, revealing the intricate\nnature of user trust in cryptocurrency markets. This study contributes\nsignificantly to interdisciplinary research, bridging distributed systems,\nbehavioral finance, and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). It offers valuable\ninsights for the distributed computing community, particularly in understanding\nand applying distributed trust mechanisms in digital economies, paving the way\nfor future research that could further explore the socio-economic dimensions\nand leverage blockchain data in this dynamic domain.",

Originally developed to\naddress the unexpectedly slow reduction in volatility as firm size increases,\nthese models also explain the shape of the distribution of firm growth rates.\n  We introduce new theoretical insights regarding the relationship between firm\nsize and growth rate statistics within this framework, directly linking the\ngrowth statistics of a firm to how diversified it is. The non-intuitive nature\nof our results arises from the fat-tailed distributions of the size and the\nnumber of sub-units, which suggest the categorization of firms into three\ndistinct diversification types: well-diversified firms with sizes evenly\ndistributed across many sub-units, firms with many sub-units but concentrated\nsize in just a few, and poorly diversified firms consisting of only a small\nnumber of sub-units.\n  Inspired by our theoretical findings, we identify new empirical patterns in\nfirm growth. Our findings show that growth volatility, when adjusted by average\nsize-conditioned volatility, has a size-independent distribution, but with a\ntail that is much too thin to be in agreement with the predictions of granular\nmodels. Furthermore, the predicted Gaussian distribution of growth rates, even\nwhen rescaled for firm-specific volatility, remains fat-tailed across all\nsizes. Such discrepancies not only challenge the granularity hypothesis but\nalso underscore the need for deeper exploration into the mechanisms driving\nfirm growth.",

        "abstract": "Crowdsourcing has evolved as an organizational approach to distributed\nproblem solving and innovation. As contests are embedded in online communities\nand evaluation rights are assigned to the crowd, community members face a\ntension: they find themselves exposed to both competitive motives to win the\ncontest prize and collaborative participation motives in the community. The\ncompetitive motive suggests they may evaluate rivals strategically according to\ntheir self-interest, the collaborative motive suggests they may evaluate their\npeers truthfully according to mutual interest. Using field data from Threadless\non 38 million peer evaluations of more than 150,000 submissions across 75,000\nindividuals over 10 years and two natural experiments to rule out alternative\nexplanations, we answer the question of how community members resolve this\ntension. We show that as their skill level increases, they become increasingly\ncompetitive and shift from using self-promotion to sabotaging their closest\ncompetitors. However, we also find signs of collaborative behavior when\nhigh-skilled members show leniency toward those community members who do not\ndirectly threaten their chance of winning. We explain how the individual-level\nuse of strategic evaluations translates into important organizational-level\noutcomes by affecting the community structure through individuals' long-term\nparticipation. While low-skill targets of sabotage are less likely to\nparticipate in future contests, high-skill targets are more likely. This\nsuggests a feedback loop between competitive evaluation behavior and future\nparticipation. These findings have important implications for the literature on\ncrowdsourcing design, and the evolution and sustainability of crowdsourcing\ncommunities.",

A system dynamics model was developed to\nundertake ex ante analysis of the effect of AI-capital deepening on labour\nunderutilisation and demand in the economy. Results indicate that even a\nmoderate increase in the AI-capital-to-labour ratio could increase labour\nunderutilisation to double its current level, decrease per capita disposable\nincome by 26% (95% interval, 20.6% - 31.8%), and decrease the consumption index\nby 21% (95% interval, 13.6% - 28.3%) by mid-2050. To prevent a reduction in per\ncapita disposable income due to the estimated increase in underutilization, at\nleast a 10.8-fold increase in the new job creation rate would be necessary.\nResults demonstrate the feasibility of an AI-capital- to-labour ratio threshold\nbeyond which even high rates of new job creation cannot prevent declines in\nconsumption. The precise threshold will vary across economies, emphasizing the\nurgent need for empirical research tailored to specific contexts.

A secondary public distributed ledger whose\nblocks are identified by a hash reference that is recorded in the bank\nstatement available to the payer and the payee allows for checking the accuracy\nof the first public distributed ledger by comparing the transactions made in\none day, one region and one type of concept. However, the transactions made or\nreceived by the government are recorded with a much higher level of detail in\nthe first ledger and a higher level of disclosure in the second ledger. The\nresult is a tool that is able to accurately track public spending, to keep\nprivacy of individuals and companies and to make statistical analysis and\nexperiments or real tests in the economy of a country. This tool has the\npotential to assist public policymakers in demonstrating the societal benefits\nresulting from their policies, thereby enabling more informed decision-making\nfor future policy endeavours.",

        "abstract": "There are many benefits and costs that come from people and firms clustering\ntogether in space. Agglomeration economies, in particular, are the\nmanifestation of centripetal forces that make larger cities disproportionately\nmore wealthy than smaller cities, pulling together individuals and firms in\nclose physical proximity. Measuring agglomeration economies, however, is not\neasy, and the identification of its causes is still debated. Such association\nof productivity with size can arise from interactions that are facilitated by\ncities (\"positive externalities\"), but also from more productive individuals\nmoving in and sorting into large cities (\"self-sorting\"). Under certain\ncircumstances, even pure randomness can generate increasing returns to scale.\nIn this chapter, we discuss some of the empirical observations, models,\nmeasurement challenges, and open question associated with the phenomenon of\nagglomeration economies. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of urban\ncomplexity theory, and in particular urban scaling, for the literature in\nagglomeration economies.",

Here, we fill\nthis gap by presenting Course-Skill Atlas -- a longitudinal dataset of skills\ninferred from over three million course syllabi taught at nearly three thousand\nU.S. higher education institutions. To construct Course-Skill Atlas, we apply\nnatural language processing to quantify the alignment between course syllabi\nand detailed workplace activities (DWAs) used by the DOL to describe\noccupations. We then aggregate these alignment scores to create skill profiles\nfor institutions and academic majors. Our dataset offers a large-scale\nrepresentation of college education's role in preparing students for the labor\nmarket. Overall, Course-Skill Atlas can enable new research on the source of\nskills in the context of workforce development and provide actionable insights\nfor shaping the future of higher education to meet evolving labor demands,\nespecially in the face of new technologies.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines how gender, birth order, and innate ability shape\nwithin-household disparities in children's educational attainment in developing\ncountries. Using data from Benin, I find that in households with non-educated\nparents, gender and birth order drive over two-thirds of the average\neducational attainment disparities among adult children, while their influence\ndecreases to one-third in households with college-educated parents.\nFurthermore, average inequality, measured by the range of children's\neducational attainment is twice as high among non-educated parents compared to\ncollege-educated parents. I propose and estimate a structural model of\neducational attainment choices within-family. Using the model, I show that the\nabsence of gender and birth order effects does not lead to a significant\nreduction in the average within-family disparities in children's educational\nattainment. Additionally, in theory, ensuring that every child has at least one\nyear of education lowers average within-family educational inequality. Yet,\neven in this scenario, daughters tend to receive less education than sons, and\npractical efforts to achieve universal entry are less effective than the\ntheoretical model.",

This transition was aimed at improving\nagricultural productivity and fostering sustainable regional economic\ndevelopment but also led to new challenges such as uneven distribution of land\nresources, unclear property rights, and underinvestment in rural\ninfrastructure. However, managing all of that effectively poses significant\nchallenges and opportunities.

Structural causal models provide a\nlanguage to state hypotheses, a blueprint for constructing LLM-based agents, an\nexperimental design, and a plan for data analysis. The fitted structural causal\nmodel becomes an object available for prediction or the planning of follow-on\nexperiments. We demonstrate the approach with several scenarios: a negotiation,\na bail hearing, a job interview, and an auction. In each case, causal\nrelationships are both proposed and tested by the system, finding evidence for\nsome and not others. We provide evidence that the insights from these\nsimulations of social interactions are not available to the LLM purely through\ndirect elicitation. When given its proposed structural causal model for each\nscenario, the LLM is good at predicting the signs of estimated effects, but it\ncannot reliably predict the magnitudes of those estimates. In the auction\nexperiment, the in silico simulation results closely match the predictions of\nauction theory, but elicited predictions of the clearing prices from the LLM\nare inaccurate. However, the LLM's predictions are dramatically improved if the\nmodel can condition on the fitted structural causal model. In short, the LLM\nknows more than it can (immediately) tell.",

EVs enact as a boon to the\nsociety by providing zero tailpipe emissions, better comfort, low lifecycle\ncost and higher connectivity. The article aims to provide scientific\ninformation through the literature across various aspects of EVs in their\nlifetime and thus, assist the scholarly community and various organisations to\nunderstand the impact of EVs. In this study we have gathered information from\nthe articles published in SCOPUS database and through grey literature with the\nfocus of information post 2009. After identification of various factors while\npurchasing the vehicle, the total cost of ownership (TCO) for vehicles is\ncalculated and their average TCO for each segment is considered for the study.\nFollowing that, we investigate the ranking of EVs, vehicles powered by internal\ncombustion engines (ICEVs), and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) in a variety of\nprice segments by employing a combination of two different multi-criteria\ndecision making (MCDM) techniques. Initially, best-worst method (BWM) is used\nto determine the weights of each of the identified criterion, which is\nthereafter, used in conjunction with the technique for order preference by\nsimilarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to compute the rank of the available\nalternatives using BWM. The ranking obtained clearly indicates that EVs should\nbe first purchase choice of the consumers, followed by HEVs and ICEVs\nrespectively. Thus, the results help us conclude that EVs enact as a\nsustainable means of transport for the future.",

To quantitatively measure fair income distribution, this study\nemploys the fairness benchmarks that are derived from the distributions of\nathletes' salaries in professional sports which satisfy the concepts of\ndistributive justice and procedural justice, the no-envy principle of fair\nallocation, and the general consensus or the international norm criterion of a\nmeaningful benchmark.

        "title": "Reference Model Based Learning in Expectation Formation: Experimental Evidence",
        "abstract": "How do people form expectations about future prices in financial markets? One\nof the dominant learning rules that explains the forecasting behavior is the\nAdaptive Expectation Rule (ADA), which suggests that people adjust their\npredictions by adapting to the most recent prediction error at a constant\nweight. However, this rule also implies that they will continually learn and\nadapt until the prediction error is zero, which contradicts recent experimental\nevidence showing that people usually stop learning long before reaching zero\nprediction error. A more recent learning rule, Reference Model Based Learning\n(RMBL), extends and generalizes ADA, hypothesizing that: i) People apply ADA\nbut dynamically adjust the adaptive coefficient with regards to the\nauto-correlation of the prediction error in the most recent two periods; ii)\nMeanwhile, they also utilize a satisficing rule so that people would only\nadjust their adaptive coefficient when the prediction error is higher than\ntheir anticipation. This paper utilizes a rich set of experimental data with\nobservations of 41,490 predictions from 801 subjects from the\nLearning-to-Forecast Experiments (LtFEs), i.e., the experiment that has been\nused to study expectation formation. Our results concludes that RMBL fits\nbetter than ADA in all the experiments.",

        "abstract": "We consider a market of risky financial assets where the participants are an\ninformed trader, a mass of uniformed traders and noisy liquidity providers. We\nprove the existence of a market-clearing equilibrium when the insider\ninternalizes her power to impact prices. In the price-impact equilibrium the\ninsider strategically reveals a noisier (compared to when the insider takes\nprices as given) signal, and prices are less reactive to the publicly available\ninformation. In contrast to the related literature, we show that in the\nprice-impact equilibrium, the insider's ex-ante welfare monotonically increases\nin the signal precision. This clarifies when a trader with market power is\nmotivated to both obtain and refine her private information. Furthermore, even\nthough the uniformed traders act as price-takers, the effect of price impact is\nex-ante welfare improving for them. By contrast, internalization of price\nimpact may reduce insider ex-ante welfare. This happens provided the insider is\nsufficiently risk averse and the uninformed traders are sufficiently risk\ntolerant.",

The observed distribution is well captured\nby a partition of the domain space into six clusters; the temporal movement of\ndomain names across these six positions yields insights into the Australian\nDomain Space and exhibits correlations with other non-structural\ncharacteristics.

Further\ninvestigation demonstrates that 35 countries in OECD share similar harmonic\ncentrality distributions.

To evaluate the accuracy of the predictions, we take\nadvantage of the fact that the training data at the time of our experiments\n(mid 2023) stopped at September 2021, and ask about events that happened in\n2022. We employed two prompting strategies: direct prediction and what we call\nfuture narratives which ask ChatGPT to tell fictional stories set in the future\nwith characters retelling events that happened in the past, but after ChatGPT's\ntraining data had been collected. We prompted ChatGPT to engage in\nstorytelling, particularly within economic contexts. After analyzing 100\ntrials, we find that future narrative prompts significantly enhanced\nChatGPT-4's forecasting accuracy. This was especially evident in its\npredictions of major Academy Award winners as well as economic trends, the\nlatter inferred from scenarios where the model impersonated public figures like\nthe Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell. As a falsification exercise, we\nrepeated our experiments in May 2024 at which time the models included more\nrecent training data. ChatGPT-4's accuracy significantly improved when the\ntraining window included the events being prompted for, achieving 100% accuracy\nin many instances. The poorer accuracy for events outside of the training\nwindow suggests that in the 2023 prediction experiments, ChatGPT-4 was forming\npredictions based solely on its training data. Narrative prompting also\nconsistently outperformed direct prompting. These findings indicate that\nnarrative prompts leverage the models' capacity for hallucinatory narrative\nconstruction, facilitating more effective data synthesis and extrapolation than\nstraightforward predictions. Our research reveals new aspects of LLMs'\npredictive capabilities and suggests potential future applications in\nanalytical contexts.",

We propose a parsimonious matching model in random graphs\nand identify the flexibility allocation that optimizes the expected size of a\nmaximum matching. Our findings reveal that flexibility allocation is a\nfirst-order issue: for a given flexibility budget, the resulting matching size\ncan vary greatly depending on how the budget is allocated. Moreover, even in\nthe simple and symmetric settings we study, the quest for the optimal\nallocation is complicated. In particular, easy and costly mistakes can be made\nif the flexibility decisions on the demand and supply side are optimized\nindependently (e.g., by two different teams in the company), rather than\njointly. To guide the search for optimal flexibility allocation, we uncover two\neffects, flexibility cannibalization, and flexibility abundance, that govern\nwhen the optimal design places the flexibility budget only on one side or\nequally on both sides. In doing so we identify the study of two-sided\nflexibility as a significant aspect of platform efficiency.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated gender disparities in medical and\nacademic careers. In this study, we examine the impact of COVID-19 as a new\nresearch topic on the presence of women in key authorship positions in\nbiomedical research. We determine author's gender based on the names listed on\ntheir scientific publications and analyze the changes in the composition of the\nscientific teams after the COVID-19 outbreak. Using a Difference-in-Differences\napproach, we find that although the share of female authorships has increased\noverall, women are less likely to be first or last authors (the most\nprestigious positions) on COVID-19-related research papers and more likely to\nbe found in middle author positions. Stay-at-home mandates, the journal\nimportance and funding opportunities do not fully account for the decline of\nwomen in key author positions. The main difference in first authorship is due\nto the composition of the team and the experience of the lead authors in\nCOVID-19 related research. First authorship by women declined after teams of\nnovices emerged, where lead authors have no prior experience in COVID-related\nresearch. Discretionality in first-author appointments for newcomers, combined\nwith high pressure to publish quickly, may have led to discriminatory biases.\nConversely, there may also be differences in risk-taking attitudes in doing\nresearch in unfamiliar domains. Monitoring gender inequality in scientific\nproduction is crucial for reducing gender inequalities and for implementing\ntimely policies that ensure equal access to emerging research topics.",

A survey of\nINSEAD's global alumni base revealed several intriguing insights into\nperceptions and engagements with generative AI across a broad spectrum of\ndemographics, industries, and geographies. Notably, there's a prevailing\noptimism about the role of generative AI in enhancing productivity and\ninnovation, as evidenced by the 90% of respondents being excited about its\ntime-saving and efficiency benefits. Analysis revealed different attitudes\nabout adoption and use across demographic variables. Younger respondents are\nsignificantly more excited about generative AI and more likely to be using it\nat work and in personal life than older participants. Those in Europe have a\nsomewhat more distant view of generative AI than those in North America in\nAsia, in that they see the gains more likely to be captured by organizations\nthan individuals, and are less likely to be using it in professional and\npersonal contexts than those in North America and Asia. This may also be\nrelated to the fact that those in Europe are more likely to be working in\nFinancial Services and less likely to be working in Information Technology\nindustries than those in North America and Asia. Despite this, those in Europe\nare more likely to see AGI happening faster than those in North America,\nalthough this may reflect less interaction with generative AI in personal and\nprofessional contexts. These findings collectively underscore the complex and\nmultifaceted perceptions of generative AI's role in society, pointing to both\nits promising potential and the challenges it presents.",

This happens irrespective of\nwhether income differences are due to luck or merit. While the\nprice-discriminating store does attract some new high-income consumers, it\ncannot compensate the loss of existing consumers.

        "abstract": "This study uses data from the China Educational Panel Survey (CEPS) to design\na classroom assignment policy that maximizes peer effects. Our approach\ncomprises three steps: firstly, we develop a friendship formation discrete\nchoice model and estimate it with an interpretable neural network architecture,\nPeerNN, generating an adjacency-probability matrix $\\Omega$ that reflects\nfriendship formation probabilities. Secondly, we incorporate $\\Omega$ into a\nlinear-in-means model to estimate peer effects. The peer effect parameter,\n$\\beta$, has a different interpretation from the conventional linear-in-means\nmodel and opens up a strategic scope of mean-maximizing classroom assignment\npolicy. By exploiting the conditional random classroom assignment in many\nChinese middle schools, we construct a valid instrument to address the\nendogeneity issue induced by $\\Omega$ and consistently estimate $\\beta$.\nLastly, utilizing the estimates of $\\Omega$ and $\\beta$, we employ a genetic\nalgorithm (GA) to search for the mean-maximizing class assignment policy.\nThough the result is much more efficient (i.e. more positive average peer\neffect) than random classroom assignment (i.e. the current practice in most\nChinese middle schools), GA policy is highly inequitable: a small number of\nstudents are predicted to experience severely negative peer effects. To balance\nstudents' academic performance with educational equity, we propose a fairness\nmetric and penalize classroom assignment that generates large variances in peer\neffects. The modified method is called algorithmically fair genetic algorithm\n(AFGA). AFGA policy is less efficient but much more equitable. We allow\nuser-defined parameters for AFGA such that the school principals can adjust the\ntrade-off between efficiency and equity according to their preferences.",

        "abstract": "The steady flow of social-media cases toward the Supreme Court shows a nation\nreworking its fundamental relationship with technology. The cases raise a host\nof questions ranging from difficult to impossible: how to nurture a vibrant\npublic square when a few tech giants dominate the flow of information, how\nsocial media can be at the same time free from conformist groupthink and also\nprotected against harmful disinformation campaigns, and how government and\nindustry can cooperate on such problems without devolving toward censorship.\n  To such profound questions, this Essay offers a comparatively modest\ncontribution -- what not to do. Always the lawyer's instinct is toward analogy,\nconsidering what has come before and how it reveals what should come next.\nAlmost invariably, that is the right choice. The law's cautious evolution\nprotects society from disruptive change. But almost is not always, and, with\nsocial media, disruptive change is already upon us. Using social-media laws\nfrom Texas and Florida as a case study, this Essay shows how social-media's\ndistinct features render it poorly suited to analysis by analogy and argues\nthat courts should instead shift their attention toward crafting legal\ndoctrines targeted to address social media's unique ills.",

Our study highlighted the resilience of PI in sectors like\nUtilities, Retail, Finance, Real Estate, and Healthcare, with Farming showing\nan early recovery in PI, despite significant initial setbacks. In contrast, PI\nin Accommodation and Food Services experienced delayed recovery, contributing\nsignificantly to the overall impact variance alongside Farming (53.26\\% and\n33.26\\% respectively).

Smart contracts offer several\nbenefits, including their ability to execute automatically without requiring\nhuman intervention, their provision of public visibility of contract provisions\non the Block Chain, their avoidance of financial crimes like Money Laundering,\nand their prevention of contract abuses. However, disputes arising from smart\ncontracts still require human intervention, presenting unique challenges in\nenforcing these contracts, such as evidentiary issues, enforceability of\nwaivers of defenses, and jurisdictional and choice-of-law considerations. Due\nto the novel nature of smart contracts, there are currently no standardized\nregulations that apply to them.

The proposed\nmethodology was implemented, and results show that the most influential factors\nfor the successful application of blockchain transactions as smart contracts in\na manufacturing company are: turnover, the counter argument, vision, components\nfor building, and system outcome quality.

Using data from the German Structure of Earnings Survey in\n2010, 2014, and 2018, we find empirical evidence that the minimum wage\nsignificantly reduces inequality in hourly and monthly wages. While various\ntheoretical mechanisms suggest a reduction in working hours, these remain\nunchanged on average. However, minijobbers experience a notable reduction in\nworking hours which can be linked to the specific institutional framework.\nRegarding employment, the results show no effects for regular jobs, but there\nis a noteworthy decline in minijobs, driven by transitions to regular\nemployment and non-employment. The transitions in non-employment imply a wage\nelasticity of employment of -0.1 for minijobs.

In\napplying our framework to Louisiana, we estimate up to 50 million tCO2/y of\nindustrial emissions (out of today's total emissions of 130 MtCO2/y) can be\ncaptured at under 100 USD/tCO2, and up to 100 MtCO2/y at under 120 USD/tCO2. We\nidentified 98 potential storage sites with estimated aggregate total\ninjectivity between 330 and 730 MtCO2/yr and storage costs ranging from 8 to 17\nUSD/tCO2. We find dramatic reductions in the aggregate pipeline length and CO2\ntransport cost per tonne when groups of capture plants share pipeline\ninfrastructure rather than build dedicated single-user pipelines. Smaller\nfacilities (emitting less than 1 MtCO2/y), which account for a quarter of\nLouisiana's industrial emissions, see the largest transport cost benefits from\nsharing of infrastructure. Pipeline routes designed to avoid disadvantaged\ncommunities (social and environmental justice) so as not to reinforce\nhistorical practices of disenfranchisement involve only modestly higher\npipeline lengths and costs.",

        "abstract": "In traditional decision making processes, social biases of human decision\nmakers can lead to unequal economic outcomes for underrepresented social\ngroups, such as women, racial or ethnic minorities. Recently, the increasing\npopularity of Large language model based artificial intelligence suggests a\npotential transition from human to AI based decision making. How would this\nimpact the distributional outcomes across social groups? Here we investigate\nthe gender and racial biases of OpenAIs GPT, a widely used LLM, in a high\nstakes decision making setting, specifically assessing entry level job\ncandidates from diverse social groups. Instructing GPT to score approximately\n361000 resumes with randomized social identities, we find that the LLM awards\nhigher assessment scores for female candidates with similar work experience,\neducation, and skills, while lower scores for black male candidates with\ncomparable qualifications. These biases may result in a 1 or 2 percentage point\ndifference in hiring probabilities for otherwise similar candidates at a\ncertain threshold and are consistent across various job positions and\nsubsamples. Meanwhile, we also find stronger pro female and weaker anti black\nmale patterns in democratic states. Our results demonstrate that this LLM based\nAI system has the potential to mitigate the gender bias, but it may not\nnecessarily cure the racial bias. Further research is needed to comprehend the\nroot causes of these outcomes and develop strategies to minimize the remaining\nbiases in AI systems. As AI based decision making tools are increasingly\nemployed across diverse domains, our findings underscore the necessity of\nunderstanding and addressing the potential unequal outcomes to ensure equitable\noutcomes across social groups.",

When consumers visit\na marketplace's webpage for a specific item, in addition to that item, the\nmarketplace might also display a ranked listing of sponsored items from various\nthird-party sellers. These sellers are charged an advertisement fee if a user\npurchases any of the sponsored items from this listing. Determining how to rank\nthese sponsored items for each incoming visit is a crucial challenge for online\nmarketplaces, a problem known as sponsored listings ranking (SLR). The major\ndifficulty of SLR lies in balancing the trade-off between maximizing the\noverall revenue and recommending high-quality and relevant ranked listings.\nWhile a more relevant ranking may result in more purchases and consumer\nengagement, the marketplace also needs to take account of the potential revenue\nwhen making ranking decisions. Due to the latency requirement and historical\nreasons, many online marketplaces use score-based ranking algorithms for SLR\noptimization. Alternatively, recent research also discusses obtaining the\nranking by solving linear programming (LP). In this paper, we collaborate with\na leading online global marketplace and conduct a series of field experiments\nto compare the performance of the score-based ranking algorithms and the\nLP-based algorithms.

        "title": "Does AI help humans make better decisions? A statistical evaluation framework for experimental and observational studies",
        "abstract": "The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), or more generally data-driven\nalgorithms, has become ubiquitous in today's society. Yet, in many cases and\nespecially when stakes are high, humans still make final decisions. The\ncritical question, therefore, is whether AI helps humans make better decisions\ncompared to a human-alone or AI-alone system. We introduce a new methodological\nframework to empirically answer this question with a minimal set of\nassumptions. We measure a decision maker's ability to make correct decisions\nusing standard classification metrics based on the baseline potential outcome.\nWe consider a single-blinded and unconfounded treatment assignment, where the\nprovision of AI-generated recommendations is assumed to be randomized across\ncases with humans making final decisions. Under this study design, we show how\nto compare the performance of three alternative decision-making\nsystems--human-alone, human-with-AI, and AI-alone. Importantly, the AI-alone\nsystem includes any individualized treatment assignment, including those that\nare not used in the original study. We also show when AI recommendations should\nbe provided to a human-decision maker, and when one should follow such\nrecommendations. We apply the proposed methodology to our own randomized\ncontrolled trial evaluating a pretrial risk assessment instrument. We find that\nthe risk assessment recommendations do not improve the classification accuracy\nof a judge's decision to impose cash bail. Furthermore, we find that replacing\na human judge with algorithms--the risk assessment score and a large language\nmodel in particular--leads to a worse classification performance.",

We assume that human work can be decomposed into atomistic tasks\nthat differ in their complexity. Advances in technology make ever more complex\ntasks amenable to automation. The effects on wages depend on a race between\nautomation and capital accumulation. If the distribution of task complexity\nexhibits a sufficiently thick infinite tail, then there is always enough work\nfor humans, and wages may rise forever. By contrast, if the complexity of tasks\nthat humans can perform is bounded and full automation is reached, then wages\ncollapse. But declines may occur even before if large-scale automation outpaces\ncapital accumulation and makes labor too abundant. Automating productivity\ngrowth may lead to broad-based gains in the returns to all factors. By\ncontrast, bottlenecks to growth from irreproducible scarce factors may\nexacerbate the decline in wages.",

        "abstract": "In many supply chains, the current efforts at digitalization have led to\nimproved information exchanges between manufacturers and their customers.\nSpecifically, demand forecasts are often provided by the customers and\nregularly updated as the related customer information improves. In this paper,\nwe investigate the influence of forecast updates on the production planning\nmethod of Material Requirements Planning (MRP). A simulation study was carried\nout to assess how updates in information affect the setting of planning\nparameters in a rolling horizon MRP planned production system. An intuitive\nresult is that information updates lead to disturbances in the production\norders for the MRP standard, and, therefore, an extension for MRP to mitigate\nthese effects is developed. A large numerical simulation experiment shows that\nthe MRP safety stock exploitation heuristic, that has been developed, leads to\nsignificantly improved results as far as inventory and backorder costs are\nconcerned. An interesting result is that the fixed-order-quantity lotsizing\npolicy performs - in most instances - better than the fixed-order-period\nlotsizing policy, when periodic forecast updates occur. In addition, the\nsimulation study shows that underestimating demand is marginally more costly\nthan overestimating it, based on the comparative analysis of all instances.\nFurthermore, the results indicate that the MRP safety stock exploitation\nheuristic can mitigate the negative effects of biased forecasts.",

This study quantifies and measures the\nvulnerability of the street networks of every urban area in the world then\nmodels the relationships between vulnerability and street network design\ncharacteristics. To do so, we simulate over 2.4 billion trips across more than\n8,000 urban areas in 178 countries, while also simulating network disruption\nevents representing floods, earthquakes, and targeted attacks. We find that\ndisrupting high-centrality nodes severely impacts network function. All else\nequal, networks with higher connectivity, fewer chokepoints, or less circuity\nare less vulnerable to disruption's impacts. This study thus contributes a new\nglobal understanding of network design and vulnerability to the literature.

This\nbottleneck could be circumvented by increasing local hydrogen production,\nutilizing pipelines, or liquefied ammonia as an energy carrier for hydrogen.\nFurthermore, the regional concentration of shipyard locations raises concerns\nabout diversification.

Based on a unique data set published in the context of the BZR for the\ntarget year 2025, we compare various pricing rules for the German power market.\nWe compare market clearing and pricing for different zonal and nodal models,\nincluding their generation costs and associated redispatch costs. In numerical\nexperiments with this dataset, the differences in the average prices in\ndifferent zones are low. Congestion arises as well, but not necessarily on the\ncross-zonal interconnectors. The total costs across different configurations\nare similar and the reduction of standard deviations in prices is also small.\nThis might be different with other load and generation scenarios, but the BZR\ndata is important as it was created to make a decision about splits of the\nexisting bidding zones. Nodal pricing rules lead to the lowest total cost. We\nalso evaluate differences of nodal pricing rules with respect to the necessary\nuplift payments, which is relevant in the context of the current discussion on\nnon-uniform pricing in the EU.

To model the capture price, practitioners often use\neither fundamental or statistical approaches to model future market prices,\nwhich both have their inherent limitations. We propose a new approach that\nblends the logic of fundamental electricity market models with statistical\nlearning techniques. In particular, we use regularized inverse optimization in\na quadratic fundamental bottom-up model of the power market to estimate the\nmarginal costs of different technologies as a parametric function of exogenous\nfactors. We compare the out-of-sample performance in forecasting the capture\nprice using market data from three European countries and demonstrate that our\napproach outperforms established statistical learning benchmarks. We then\ndiscuss the case of a photovoltaic plant in Spain to illustrate how to use the\nmodel to value a PPA from the buyer's perspective.",

        "abstract": "Probability theory is applied to the finances of periodic growth processes.\nThe expected value of the profit rate, on accrual basis, does not directly\ndepend on divestments, neither on the capitalization path. The expected value\nof capitalization is path dependent. Because of the path-dependent\ncapitalization, the return rate on capital is path-dependent, and the\ntime-average return rate on capital differs from the expected value of the\nreturn rate on capital for the growth cycle. In the absence of intermediate\ndivestments, the internal rate of return is path-independent, thereby differing\nfrom the expected value of the rate of return on capital. It is shown that the\narea-average of internal rate of return is not representative for the rate of\nreturn on capital within an estate. It is shown that the rotation cycle length\nmaximizing the return rate on equity is independent of market interest rate.\nCorrespondingly, from the viewpoint of wealth accumulation, the often-suggested\ndependency of suitable rotation length on discount rate appears to be a\nmodeling artifact. Leverage effect enters the microeconomics of the growth\nprocesses through a separate leverage equation, where the leverage coefficient\nmay reach positive or negative values. The leverage effect on the internal rate\nof return and the net present value are discussed. Both effects are solvable,\nresulting in incorrect estimates.",

        "abstract": "We unveil that a previously-unreported vicious cycle can be created when bus\nqueues form at curbside stops along a corridor. Buses caught in this cycle\nexhibit growing variation in headways as they travel from stop to stop. Bus\n(and patron) delays accumulate in like fashion and can grow large on long, busy\ncorridors. We show that this damaging cycle can be abated in simple ways.\nPresent solutions entail holding buses at a corridor entrance and releasing\nthem as per various strategies proposed in the literature. We introduce a\nmodest variant to the simplest of these strategies. It releases buses at\nheadways that are slightly less than, or equal to, the scheduled values. It\nturns out that periodically releasing buses at slightly smaller headways can\nsubstantially reduce bus delays caused by holding so that benefits can more\nreadily outweigh costs in corridors that contain a sufficient number of serial\nbus stops. The simple variant is shown to perform about as well as, or better\nthan, other bus-holding strategies in terms of saving delays, and is more\neffective than other strategies in regularizing bus headways. We also show that\ngrouping buses from across multiple lines and holding them by group can be\neffective when patrons have the flexibility to choose buses from across all\nlines in a group. Findings come by formulating select models of bus-corridor\ndynamics and using these to simulate part of the Bus Rapid Transit corridor in\nGuangzhou, China.",

After a careful review of the\nliterature, most of the research indicated that different farming practices,\nsuch as organic farming, cover crops, conservation tillage, and agroforestry,\nplay vital roles in increasing the SOC content of the soil sustainably. Root\nexudation from cover crops increases microbial activity and helps break down\ncomplex organic compounds into organic carbon. Conservation tillage enhances\nthe soil structure and maintains carbon storage without disturbing the soil.\nAgroforestry systems boost organic carbon input and fasten nutrient cycling\nbecause the trees and crops have symbiotic relationships. Intercropping and\ncrop rotations have a role in changing the composition of plant residues and\npromoting carbon storage. There were many understanding on the complex\ninteractions between soil organic carbon dynamics and agricultural practices.\nBased on the study, the paper reveals, the role of different agricultural\npractices like Carbon storage through cover crops, crop rotation, mulching\nConservation tillage, conventional tillage, zero tillage and organic amendments\nin organic carbon storage in the soil for maximum crop yield to improve the\neconomic condition of the cultivators.",

Our strategy is facilitated by a unique high-frequency data that offers\nmonthly, in contrast to the typical biennial, information on employment,\nself-assessed health, and objective health conditions. Across a wider\npost-retirement time frame, we observe a decline in self-assessed health,\npotentially stemming from both justification bias and changes in actual health.\nHowever, this adverse effect diminishes with shorter intervals, indicating no\nevidence of such bias.

        "abstract": "As firms' pricing strategies increasingly rely on algorithms, two concerns\nhave received much attention: algorithmic tacit collusion and price\ndiscrimination. This paper investigates the interaction between these two\nissues through simulations. In each period, a new buyer arrives with\nindependently and identically distributed willingness to pay (WTP), and each\nfirm, observing private signals about WTP, adopts Q-learning algorithms to set\nprices. We document two novel mechanisms that lead to collusive outcomes. Under\nasymmetric information, the algorithm with information advantage adopts a\nBait-and-Restrained-Exploit strategy, surrendering profits on some signals by\nsetting higher prices, while exploiting limited profits on the remaining\nsignals by setting much lower prices. Under a symmetric information structure,\ncompetition on some signals facilitates convergence to supra-competitive prices\non the remaining signals. Algorithms tend to collude more on signals with\nhigher expected WTP. Both uncertainty and the lack of correlated signals\nexacerbate the degree of collusion, thereby reducing both consumer surplus and\nsocial welfare. A key implication is that the over-usage of data, both\npayoff-relevant and non-relevant, by AIs in competitive contexts will reduce\nthe degree of collusion and consequently lead to a decline in industry profits.",

It can\noccur by sudden intense precipitation and develop within minutes or hours.\nBecause of heavy debris load and speedy water, this phenomenon has remarkable\neffects on water quality. A higher flow during floods may worsens water quality\nat lakes and reservoirs that are thermally stratified (with separate density\nlayers) and decrease dissolved oxygen content. However, it is unclear how well\nthese parameters represent the response of lakes to changes in volume\ndischarge. To address this question, researchers simulate the thermal structure\nin two stratified reservoirs, considering the Rajae reservoir as a\nrepresentative reservoir in the north of Iran and Minab reservoir in the south.\nIn this study, the model realistically represented variations of dissolved\noxygen and temperature of dams Lake response to flash floods. The model\nperformance was evaluated using observed data from stations on the dams lake.\nIn this case, the inflow charge considered in a 10-day flash flood from April\n6th to April 16th during the yearly normal flow.

In this research, we\nuse the dual-privacy framework, which postulates that consumers have intrinsic\nand instrumental preferences for privacy, to understand consumers' perceived\nprivacy violations (PPVs) for current and proposed online advertising\npractices. The key idea is that different practices differ in whether\nindividual data leaves the consumer's machine or not and in how they track and\ntarget consumers; these affect, respectively, the intrinsic and instrumental\ncomponents of privacy preferences differently, leading to different PPVs for\ndifferent practices. We conducted online studies focused on consumers in the\nUnited States to elicit PPVs for various advertising practices. Our findings\nconfirm the intuition that tracking and targeting consumers under the industry\nstatus quo of behavioral targeting leads to high PPV. New technologies or\nproposals that ensure that data are kept on the consumer's machine lower PPV\nrelative to behavioral targeting but, importantly, this decrease is small.\nFurthermore, group-level targeting does not differ significantly from\nindividual-level targeting in reducing PPV. Under contextual targeting, where\nthere is no tracking, PPV is significantly reduced. Interestingly, with respect\nto PPV, consumers are indifferent between seeing untargeted ads and no ads when\nthey are not being tracked. We find that consumer perceptions of privacy\nviolations under different tracking and targeting practices may differ from\nwhat technical definitions suggest. Therefore, rather than relying solely on\ntechnical perspectives, a consumer-centric approach to privacy is needed, based\non, for instance, the dual-privacy framework.",

        "title": "Paying for Privacy: Pay-or-Tracking Walls",
        "abstract": "Prestigious news publishers, and more recently, Meta, have begun to request\nthat users pay for privacy. Specifically, users receive a notification banner,\nreferred to as a pay-or-tracking wall, that requires them to (i) pay money to\navoid being tracked or (ii) consent to being tracked. These walls have invited\nconcerns that privacy might become a luxury. However, little is known about\npay-or-tracking walls, which prevents a meaningful discussion about their\nappropriateness. This paper conducts several empirical studies and finds that\ntop EU publishers use pay-or-tracking walls. Their implementations involve\nvarious approaches, including bundling the pay option with advertising-free\naccess or additional content. The price for not being tracked exceeds the\nadvertising revenue that publishers generate from a user who consents to being\ntracked. Notably, publishers' traffic does not decline when implementing a\npay-or-tracking wall and most users consent to being tracked; only a few users\npay. In short, pay-or-tracking walls seem to provide the means for expanding\nthe practice of tracking. Publishers profit from pay-or-tracking walls and may\nobserve a revenue increase of 16.4% due to tracking more users than under a\ncookie consent banner.",

        "abstract": "With the widespread dissemination of the internet, academia envisioned free\navailability and rapid dissemination of new knowledge. However, most\nresearchers continued publishing in established journals instead of switching\nto fully open-access alternatives. That preserved the market power of the large\ncommercial publishing houses owning thousands of journals behind paywalls. To\nturn these portfolios into open access, research institutions around the globe\nhave been negotiating `transformative agreements:' Papers are published fully\nopen access, and universities pay only for the publication but not for\nsubscriptions any longer. In this paper, I demonstrate that publishers\ncontrolling a large stock of paywalled publications can use them as leverage to\nensure high revenues even with decreasing publication numbers. By that, this\nindustrial policy may harm competitors that only publish under open access.\nThis could harm competition and perpetuate the position of the incumbent\nplayers.",

        "abstract": "This study analyzed images generated by three popular generative artificial\nintelligence (AI) tools - Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALLE 2 -\nrepresenting various occupations to investigate potential bias in AI\ngenerators. Our analysis revealed two overarching areas of concern in these AI\ngenerators, including (1) systematic gender and racial biases, and (2) subtle\nbiases in facial expressions and appearances. Firstly, we found that all three\nAI generators exhibited bias against women and African Americans. Moreover, we\nfound that the evident gender and racial biases uncovered in our analysis were\neven more pronounced than the status quo when compared to labor force\nstatistics or Google images, intensifying the harmful biases we are actively\nstriving to rectify in our society. Secondly, our study uncovered more nuanced\nprejudices in the portrayal of emotions and appearances. For example, women\nwere depicted as younger with more smiles and happiness, while men were\ndepicted as older with more neutral expressions and anger, posing a risk that\ngenerative AI models may unintentionally depict women as more submissive and\nless competent than men. Such nuanced biases, by their less overt nature, might\nbe more problematic as they can permeate perceptions unconsciously and may be\nmore difficult to rectify. Although the extent of bias varied depending on the\nmodel, the direction of bias remained consistent in both commercial and\nopen-source AI generators. As these tools become commonplace, our study\nhighlights the urgency to identify and mitigate various biases in generative\nAI, reinforcing the commitment to ensuring that AI technologies benefit all of\nhumanity for a more inclusive future.",

        "abstract": "Generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and MidJourney have made\nremarkable progress in recent years. Recent literature has documented ChatGPT's\npositive impact on productivity in areas where it has strong expertise,\nattributable to extensive training datasets, such as the English language and\nPython/SQL programming. However, there is still limited literature regarding\nChatGPT's performance in areas where its capabilities could still be further\nenhanced. This paper aims to fill this gap. We conducted an experiment in which\neconomics students were asked to perform writing analysis tasks in a\nnon-English language (specifically, Thai) and math & data analysis tasks using\na less frequently used programming package (specifically, Stata). The findings\nsuggest that, on average, participants performed better using ChatGPT in terms\nof scores and time taken to complete the tasks. However, a detailed examination\nreveals that 34% of participants saw no improvement in writing analysis tasks,\nand 42% did not improve in math & data analysis tasks when employing ChatGPT.\nFurther investigation indicated that higher-ability students, as proxied by\ntheir econometrics grades, were the ones who performed worse in writing\nanalysis tasks when using ChatGPT. We also found evidence that students with\nbetter digital skills performed better with ChatGPT. This research provides\ninsights on the impact of generative AI. Thus, stakeholders can make informed\ndecisions to implement appropriate policy frameworks or redesign educational\nsystems. It also highlights the critical role of human skills in addressing and\ncomplementing the limitations of technology.",

Secondly, sudden events or increased\neconomic uncertainty can increase the overall risk spillovers. Thirdly, there\nis an aggregation of risk spillovers amongst agricultural futures based on the\ndynamic directional spillover results. Lastly, the central agricultural futures\nunder the conditional mean are CBOT corn and soybean, while CZCE hard wheat and\nlong-grained rice are the two risk spillover centers in extreme cases, as per\nthe results of the spillover network and minimum spanning tree. Based on these\nresults, decision-makers are advised to safeguard against the price risk of\nagricultural futures under sudden economic events, and investors can utilize\nthe results to construct a superior investment portfolio by taking different\nagricultural product futures as risk-leading indicators according to various\nsituations.",

Specifically, we aim to\nmaximize profit over an arbitrary sequence of multiple demand curves, each\ndependent on a distinct ancillary variable, but sharing the same price. A\nprototypical example is targeted marketing, where a firm (seller) wishes to\nsell a product over multiple markets. The firm may invest different marketing\nexpenditures for different markets to optimize customer acquisition, but must\nmaintain the same price across all markets. Moreover, markets may have\nheterogeneous demand curves, each responding to prices and marketing\nexpenditures differently. The firm's objective is to maximize its gross profit,\nthe total revenue minus marketing costs.\n  Our results are near-optimal algorithms for this class of problems in an\nadversarial bandit setting, where demand curves are arbitrary non-adaptive\nsequences, and the firm observes only noisy evaluations of chosen points on the\ndemand curves. For $n$ demand curves (markets), we prove a regret upper bound\nof $\\tilde{O}(nT^{3/4})$ and a lower bound of $\\Omega((nT)^{3/4})$ for\nmonotonic demand curves, and a regret bound of $\\tilde{\\Theta}(nT^{2/3})$ for\ndemands curves that are monotonic in price and concave in the ancillary\nvariables.",

        "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have emerged as a critical issue with profound\nimpacts on the environment, human health, and the global economy. The steady\nincrease in atmospheric CO2 levels, largely due to human activities such as\nburning fossil fuels and deforestation, has become a major contributor to\nclimate change and its associated catastrophic effects. To tackle this pressing\nchallenge, a coordinated global effort is needed, which necessitates a deep\nunderstanding of emissions patterns and trends. In this paper, we explore the\nuse of statistical modelling, specifically the lognormal distribution, as a\nframework for comprehending and predicting CO2 emissions. We build on prior\nresearch that suggests a complex distribution of emissions and seek to test the\nhypothesis that a simpler distribution can still offer meaningful insights for\npolicy-makers. We utilize data from three comprehensive databases and analyse\nsix candidate distributions (exponential, Fisk, gamma, lognormal, Lomax,\nWeibull) to identify a suitable model for global fossil CO2 emissions. Our\nfindings highlight the adequacy of the lognormal distribution in characterizing\nemissions across all countries and years studied. Furthermore, to provide\nadditional support for this distribution, we provide statistical evidence\nsupporting the applicability of Gibrat's law to those CO2 emissions. Finally,\nwe employ the lognormal model to predict emission parameters for the coming\nyears and propose two policies for reducing total fossil CO2 emissions. Our\nresearch aims to provide policy-makers with accurate and detailed information\nto support effective climate change mitigation strategies.",

The advent of\nchat-based search engines utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval\nAugmented Generation (RAG), exemplified by Bing Chat, marks an evolutionary\nleap in the search ecosystem. They demonstrate metacognitive abilities in\ninterpreting web information and crafting responses with human-like\nunderstanding and creativity. Nonetheless, the intricate nature of LLMs renders\ntheir \"cognitive\" processes opaque, challenging even their designers'\nunderstanding. This research aims to dissect the mechanisms through which an\nLLM-powered chat-based search engine, specifically Bing Chat, selects\ninformation sources for its responses. To this end, an extensive dataset has\nbeen compiled through engagements with New Bing, documenting the websites it\ncites alongside those listed by the conventional search engine. Employing\nnatural language processing (NLP) techniques, the research reveals that Bing\nChat exhibits a preference for content that is not only readable and formally\nstructured, but also demonstrates lower perplexity levels, indicating a unique\ninclination towards text that is predictable by the underlying LLM. Further\nenriching our analysis, we procure an additional dataset through interactions\nwith the GPT-4 based knowledge retrieval API, unveiling a congruent text\npreference between the RAG API and Bing Chat. This consensus suggests that\nthese text preferences intrinsically emerge from the underlying language\nmodels, rather than being explicitly crafted by Bing Chat's developers.\nMoreover, our investigation documents a greater similarity among websites cited\nby RAG technologies compared to those ranked highest by conventional search\nengines.",

We investigate how electric carsharing may impact the power sector,\ncombining three methods: sequence clustering of car travel diaries, generation\nof synthetic electric vehicle time series, and power sector modelling. We show\nthat switching to electric carsharing only moderately increases power sector\ncosts, less than 110 euros per substituted car in our main setting.

A larger\nbound range increases not only the number of routes in the choice set but also\nthe degree of dispersion in the assignment results due to a larger\nroute-specific perception variance. The misperception is contingent upon the\ndisparity between the shortest and longest travel times and the bounds. As the\nbound range decreases, the shortest route receives significant flow allocation,\nand the assignment result approaches the deterministic user equilibrium (DUE)\nflow pattern.",

        "abstract": "Ascertaining the number, type, and location of plant, insect, and animal\nspecies is essential for biodiversity conservation. However, comprehensively\nmonitoring the situation only through public fixed-point surveys is\nchallenging, and therefore information voluntarily provided by citizens assists\nin ascertaining the species distribution. To effectively encourage the\ncitizens' data sharing behavior, this study proposed a prosocial incentive\nscheme in which, if they provide species information, donations are made to\nactivities for saving endangered species. We conducted a field experiment with\nusers (N=830) of a widely-used Japanese smartphone app to which they post\nspecies photos and measured the incentive's effect on their posting behavior.\nIn addition, we measured the effect of a financial incentive scheme that\nprovides monetary rewards for posting species photos and compared the two\nincentives' effects. The analyses revealed that while the prosocial incentive\ndid not increase the number of posts on average, it did change the contents of\nposts, increasing the proportion of posts on rare species. On the contrary, the\nfinancial incentive statistically significantly increased the number of posts,\nin particular, on less rare and invasive species. Our findings suggest that the\nprosocial and financial incentives could stimulate different motivations and\nencourage different posting behaviors.",

In our data from 308 subjects in the\nUK and Germany, significantly more individuals were ordinal- and\nexpected-utility maximizers in their last 15 than in their first 15 identical\ndecision problems. Furthermore, around a quarter and a fifth of all subjects,\nrespectively, decided in those modes throughout the experiment, with nearly\nhalf revealing non-trivial indifferences. A considerable overlap was found\nbetween those consistently rational individuals and the ones who satisfied core\nprinciples of random utility theory.

        "abstract": "Background: The public hospital network in Morocco plays a crucial role in\nproviding healthcare services. However, this network faces challenges in terms\nof technical efficiency in healthcare management. Objectives: This study aimed\nto assess the technical efficiency of the public hospital network in Morocco.\nMethods: This article compares the efficiency of 77 public hospital networks\nfrom 2017 to 2020. Data were collected from the Directorate of Planning and\nFinancial Resources (DPFR) of the Health Ministry Marocco. The Data Envelopment\nAnalysis (DEA) method was employed, using three inputs (Hospital, Physician and\nParamedical) and four outputs (Functional capacity, Hospitalization days and\nAdmission). Additionally, the Malmquist index (MI) is utilized to analyse the\nfactors of production, and peer modelling is incorporated to address hospital\ninefficiency. Results: The average technical efficiency of public hospital\nnetworks under the CRS hypothesis from 2017 to 2020 is 0.697 (71% of DMUs have\na score lower than 1), indicating that these networks need to minimize their\ninputs by approximately 30.3%. The Malmquist index reveals a decline in\nproductivity gain from 2017/2018 (score of 0.980) followed by improvement in\n2018/2019 (score of 1.163). In terms of peer modelling, 72.7% of the DMUs\nshould emulate the most effective DMUs beginning in 2020, whereas the lowest\nscore was observed in 2019. Conclusion: These findings highlight the need for\nthe public hospital network in Morocco to enhance the effective and efficient\nutilization of inputs, such as the number of hospitals and medical and\nparamedical staff, to produce the same outputs, including the number of\nsurgical procedures, hospitalization days, admissions, and functional capacity.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the demand for lamb, beef, pork, and poultry in\nCanada, both at the national level and in disaggregated provinces, to identify\nmeat consumption patterns in different provinces. Meat consumption plays a\nsignificant role in Canada's economy and is an important source of calories for\nthe population. However, meat demand faces several consumption challenges due\nto logistic constraints, as a significant portion of the supply is imported\nfrom other countries. Therefore, there is a need for a better understanding of\nthe causal relationships underlying lamb, beef, pork, and poultry consumption\nin Canada. Until recently, there have been no attempts to estimate meat\nconsumption at the provincial level in Canada. Different Almost Ideal Demand\nSystem (AIDS) models have been applied for testing specifications to circumvent\nseveral econometric and theoretical problems. In particular, generalized AIDS\nand its Quadratic extension QUAIDS methods have been estimated across each\nprovince using the Iterative Linear Least Squares Estimator (ILLE) estimation\nMethod. Weekly retail meat consumption price and quantity data from 2019 to\n2022 have been used for Canada and for each province namely Quebec, Maritime\nprovinces (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island), Ontario,\ntotal West (Yukon, Northwest Territory and Nunavut), Alberta,\nManitoba-Saskatchewan and Manitoba as well as British Columbia. Consistent\ncoefficients and demand elasticities estimates reveal patterns of substitution\nand/or complementarity between the four categories of meat. Meat consumption\npatterns differ across each province. Results show that the demand for the four\ncategories of meat is responsive to price changes. Overall, lamb expenditure\nwas found to be elastic and thus considered a luxury good during the study\nperiod, while the other three categories are considered normal goods across\nCanada.",

Although literature reviews on\nBL exist, they predominantly concentrate on the pre-sent state, neglecting\nfuture trends. Therefore, a comprehensive review is imperative to ascertain\nemerging trends in BL This study employs a bibliometric approach, analyzing\n1,468 papers from the Scopus database. Various tools including R software, VOS\nviewer software, and Publish or Perish are utilized. The aim is to portray the\nknowledge map, explore the publication years, identify the top authors and\ntheir co-occurrence, reliable documents, institutions, subjects, research\nhotspots, and pioneering countries and universities in the study of BL. The\nqualitative section of this research identifies gaps and emerging trends in BL\nthrough Word Cloud charts, word growth analysis, and a review of highly cited\narticles from the past four years. Results showed that highly cited articles\nmention topics such as brand love, consumer-brand identification, and social\nnetworks and the U.S. had the most productions in this field. Besides, most\ncitations were related to Keller with 1,173 citations. Furthermore, in the\nqualitative section, social networks and brand experiences were found to be of\ninterest to researchers in the field. Finally, by introducing the antecedents\nand consequences of BL, the gaps and emerging trends in BL were identified, so\nas to present the di-rection of future research in this area.",

Most existing\nstudies address this trade-off using a weighted sum approach, which puts little\nemphasis on individual waiting times and, thus, customer satisfaction. In\ncontrast, we study how to minimize total cost while providing waiting time\nguarantees to all customers. Given box uncertainty sets for service times and\nno-shows, we introduce the Robust Appointment Scheduling Problem with Waiting\nTime Guarantees. We show that the problem is NP-hard in general and introduce a\nmixed-integer linear program that can be solved in reasonable computation time.\nFor special cases, we prove that polynomial-time variants of the well-known\nSmallest-Variance-First sequencing rule and the Bailey-Welch scheduling rule\nare optimal. Furthermore, a case study with data from the radiology department\nof a large university hospital demonstrates that the approach not only\nguarantees acceptable waiting times but, compared to existing robust\napproaches, may simultaneously reduce costs incurred by idle time and overtime.\nThis work suggests that limiting instead of minimizing customer waiting times\nis a win-win solution in the trade-off between customer satisfaction and cost\nminimization. Additionally, it provides an easy-to-implement and customizable\nappointment scheduling framework with waiting time guarantees.",

        "abstract": "Land use expansion is linked to major sustainability concerns including\nclimate change, food security and biodiversity loss. This expansion is largely\nconcentrated in so-called frontiers, defined here as places experiencing marked\ntransformations due to rapid resource exploitation. Understanding the\nmechanisms shaping these frontiers is crucial for sustainability. Previous work\nfocused mainly on explaining how active frontiers advance, in particular into\ntropical forests. Comparatively, our understanding of how frontiers emerge in\nterritories considered marginal in terms of agricultural productivity and\nglobal market integration remains weak. We synthesize conceptual tools\nexplaining resource and land-use frontiers, including theories of land rent and\nagglomeration economies, of frontiers as successive waves, spaces of\nterritorialization, friction, and opportunities, anticipation and expectation.\nWe then propose a new theory of frontier emergence, which identifies exogenous\npushes, legacies of past waves, and actors anticipations as key mechanisms by\nwhich frontiers emerge. Processes of abnormal rent creation and capture and the\nbuilt-up of agglomeration economies then constitute key mechanisms sustaining\nactive frontiers. Finally, we discuss five implications for the governance of\nfrontiers for sustainability. Our theory focuses on agriculture and\ndeforestation frontiers in the tropics, but can be inspirational for other\nfrontier processes including for extractive resources, such as minerals.",

As one of the major industries worldwide, tourism can make a\nsignificant contribution to mitigating climate change. The main objective of\nthe paper is to assess the development level of low-carbon tourism from\nmulti-aspect, using the Yellow River Basin as an example. Firstly, this study\nquantified tourism carbon dioxide emissions and tourism economy, and analyzed\ntheir evolution characteristics. The interaction and coordination degree\nbetween tourism carbon dioxide emissions and tourism economy were then analyzed\nusing the improved coupling coordination degree model. Finally, this study\nanalyzed the change in total factor productivity of low-carbon tourism by\ncalculating the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index. The results showed\nthat: (1) The tourism industry in the Yellow River Basin has the\ncharacteristics of the initial environmental Kuznets curve. (2) There was a\nstrong interaction between tourism carbon dioxide emissions and tourism\neconomy, which was manifested as mutual promotion. (3) The total factor\nproductivity of low-carbon tourism was increasing. Based on the above results,\nit could be concluded that the development level of low-carbon tourism in the\nYellow River Basin has been continuously improved from 2000 to 2019, but it is\nstill in the early development stage with the continuous growth of carbon\ndioxide emissions.",

When studying greenhouse gas emissions, one of the main\nemitters of such gases is the burning of fuels, in which transport vehicles\nthat depend on gas and oil are included. In this respect, air transport through\naircraft is one of the sources emitting such gases. Aiming to reduce gas\nemissions, one of the ways to do this is by reducing fuel consumption; for\nthis, aircraft would have to be more efficient, or the offer and demand for\nflights would be reduced. However, what if aircraft fuel consumption were\ntaxed? What would be the effects of this on air transport? Could this be one of\nthe alternatives to reduce emissions? To understand this relationship between\ntaxation and a possible reduction in fuel consumption, a study was developed by\nthe Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA), using an econometric model to\nunderstand how demand would be affected by changes in airfares. In addition, a\nsimulation of possible environmental taxes on the values of air tickets was\ncarried out to analyze the demand response and to get an idea if this taxation\nwould really solve the emission problems.",

Consequently, the dependence on commercial\nrevenues has also become increasingly important, and airport managers are\ninterested in understanding how to improve their financial results with this\nnew revenue source, as it not only improves financial outcomes but also\noptimizes passengers' time and money consumption options at airports.\nTherefore, this chapter seeks to discuss the main determinants of commercial\nrevenues at national airports, analyzing the possible impacts of the behavior\nof passengers from low-cost carriers (LCC) on these revenues, combined with\nother determining factors.",

To evaluate the degree of decentralization in PoS\nEthereum, we apply several inequality indices, including the Shannon entropy,\nthe Gini Index, the Nakamoto Coefficient, and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index\n(HHI).

Our\nsimulator facilitates the use of reinforcement learning strategies for the\nagents via an OpenAI Gym style environment definition for the economic system.\nWe demonstrate the utility of our simulator by simulating and analyzing two\nhypothetical (yet interesting) economic scenarios. The first scenario\ninvestigates the impact of heterogeneous household skills on their learned\npreferences to work at different firms. The second scenario examines the impact\nof a positive production shock to one of two firms on its pricing strategy in\ncomparison to the second firm.

We make an assumption\nthat LLMs can be used as implicit computational models of humans, and propose a\nframework to use synthetic demonstrations derived from LLMs to model\nsubrational behaviors that are characteristic of humans (e.g., myopic behavior\nor preference for risk aversion). We experimentally evaluate the ability of our\nframework to model sub-rationality through four simple scenarios, including the\nwell-researched ultimatum game and marshmallow experiment.

An important extension of the problem\nadds transaction costs, which is highly relevant from a financial perspective\nbut also challenging from a control perspective because the solution now\ninvolves singular control. A further significant extension takes us from\nadditive utility to stochastic differential utility (SDU), which allows time\npreferences and risk preferences to be disentangled.\n  In this paper, we study this extended version of the Merton problem with\nproportional transaction costs and Epstein-Zin SDU. We fully characterise all\nparameter combinations for which the problem is well posed (which may depend on\nthe level of transaction costs) and provide a full verification argument that\nrelies on no additional technical assumptions and uses primal methods only. The\ncase with SDU requires new mathematical techniques as duality methods break\ndown.\n  Even in the special case of (additive) power utility, our arguments are\nsignificantly simpler, more elegant and more far-reaching than the ones in the\nextant literature. This means that we can easily analyse aspects of the problem\nwhich previously have been very challenging, including comparative statics,\nboundary cases which heretofore have required separate treatment and the\nsituation beyond the small transaction cost regime. A key and novel idea is to\nparametrise consumption and the value function in terms of the shadow fraction\nof wealth, which may be of much wider applicability.",

Such an impact is further intensified by global trade\nintegration, causing a sharper yet slightly quicker rebounding output drop. The\nspillover effects are significantly amplified when US monetary policy\ntightening is accompanied by an increase in monetary policy uncertainty.\nFinally, emerging markets exhibit considerable heterogeneity in their responses\nto US monetary policy shocks.",

Second, infrequently paired datasets\nmaintain a strong association with citation even after controlling for the\natypicality of dataset topics. In contrast, the atypicality of dataset topics\nhas a much smaller positive impact on citation counts. Third, smaller and less\nexperienced research teams tend to use atypical combinations of datasets in\nresearch more frequently than their larger and more experienced counterparts.\nLastly, despite the benefits of data combination, papers that amalgamate data\nremain infrequent. This finding suggests that the unconventional combination of\ndatasets is an under-utilized but powerful strategy correlated with the\nscientific impact and broader dissemination of scientific discoveries",

        "abstract": "Price perception by consumers represents a challenge to the ability of a\nbusiness to correctly and profitably price and sell their products or services\nin a given market and any new target market. Complicating the perception of\nprices is the dynamics of price and income elasticity, both of which are key\nfor estimating demand. This article proposes a novel and elegant identity that\nconceptualizes elasticity as a means of quantifying the potential for price\nperception problems in a market. Elasticity studies from 1990 to 2023 (n=30)\nwere sampled to evaluate the relationship between price and income elasticity\nfor various consumer commodities using the identity. The results suggest that,\ngiven known price and income elasticity values, a business can anticipate\npricing perception problems in advance and address the potential for damaging\ndistortion of their value proposition. Further, the business can use this\ninsight to correctly choose a strategic pricing approach.",

While\nextensive research has explored factors such as gender, race, and education in\nnetwork formation, one dimension that has received less attention is the gender\nof one's child. Children tend to form friendships with same-gender peers,\npotentially leading their parents to interact based on their child's gender.\nFocusing on households with children aged 3-5, we leverage a rich dataset from\nrural Bangladesh to investigate the role of children's gender in parental\nnetwork formation. We estimate an equilibrium model of network formation that\nconsiders a child's gender alongside other socioeconomic factors.\nCounterfactual analyses reveal that children's gender significantly shapes\nparents' network structure. Specifically, if all children share the same\ngender, households would have approximately 15% more links, with a stronger\neffect for families having girls. Importantly, the impact of children's gender\non network structure is on par with or even surpasses that of factors such as\nincome distribution, parental occupation, education, and age. These findings\ncarry implications for debates surrounding coed versus single-sex schools, as\nwell as policies that foster inter-gender social interactions among children.",

        "abstract": "There are two strategic and longstanding questions about cyber risk that\norganizations largely have been unable to answer: What is an organization's\nestimated risk exposure and how does its security compare with peers? Answering\nboth requires industry-wide data on security posture, incidents, and losses\nthat, until recently, have been too sensitive for organizations to share. Now,\nprivacy enhancing technologies (PETs) such as cryptographic computing can\nenable the secure computation of aggregate cyber risk metrics from a peer group\nof organizations while leaving sensitive input data undisclosed. As these new\naggregate data become available, analysts need ways to integrate them into\ncyber risk models that can produce more reliable risk assessments and allow\ncomparison to a peer group. This paper proposes a new framework for\nbenchmarking cyber posture against peers and estimating cyber risk within\nspecific economic sectors using the new variables emerging from secure\ncomputations. We introduce a new top-line variable called the Defense Gap Index\nrepresenting the weighted security gap between an organization and its peers\nthat can be used to forecast an organization's own security risk based on\nhistorical industry data. We apply this approach in a specific sector using\ndata collected from 25 large firms, in partnership with an industry ISAO, to\nbuild an industry risk model and provide tools back to participants to estimate\ntheir own risk exposure and privately compare their security posture with their\npeers.",

        "abstract": "Agent-based models (ABMs) have shown promise for modelling various real world\nphenomena incompatible with traditional equilibrium analysis. However, a\ncritical concern is the manual definition of behavioural rules in ABMs. Recent\ndevelopments in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) offer a way to\naddress this issue from an optimisation perspective, where agents strive to\nmaximise their utility, eliminating the need for manual rule specification.\nThis learning-focused approach aligns with established economic and financial\nmodels through the use of rational utility-maximising agents. However, this\nrepresentation departs from the fundamental motivation for ABMs: that realistic\ndynamics emerging from bounded rationality and agent heterogeneity can be\nmodelled. To resolve this apparent disparity between the two approaches, we\npropose a novel technique for representing heterogeneous processing-constrained\nagents within a MARL framework. The proposed approach treats agents as\nconstrained optimisers with varying degrees of strategic skills, permitting\ndeparture from strict utility maximisation. Behaviour is learnt through\nrepeated simulations with policy gradients to adjust action likelihoods. To\nallow efficient computation, we use parameterised shared policy learning with\ndistributions of agent skill levels. Shared policy learning avoids the need for\nagents to learn individual policies yet still enables a spectrum of bounded\nrational behaviours. We validate our model's effectiveness using real-world\ndata on a range of canonical $n$-agent settings, demonstrating significantly\nimproved predictive capability.",

        "abstract": "In credence goods markets such as health care or repair services, consumers\nrely on experts with superior information to adequately diagnose and treat\nthem. Experts, however, are constrained in their diagnostic abilities, which\nhurts market efficiency and consumer welfare. Technological breakthroughs that\nsubstitute or complement expert judgments have the potential to alleviate\nconsumer mistreatment. This article studies how competitive experts adopt novel\ndiagnostic technologies when skills are heterogeneously distributed and\nobfuscated to consumers. We differentiate between novel technologies that\nincrease expert abilities, and algorithmic decision aids that complement expert\njudgments, but do not affect an expert's personal diagnostic precision. We show\nthat high-ability experts may be incentivized to forego the decision aid in\norder to escape a pooling equilibrium by differentiating themselves from\nlow-ability experts. Results from an online experiment support our hypothesis,\nshowing that high-ability experts are significantly less likely than\nlow-ability experts to invest into an algorithmic decision aid. Furthermore, we\ndocument pervasive under-investments, and no effect on expert honesty.",

Our methodology involved using a dataset from a human voting\nexperiment to establish a baseline for human preferences and conducting a\ncorresponding experiment with LLM agents. We observed that the choice of voting\nmethods and the presentation order influenced LLM voting outcomes. We found\nthat varying the persona can reduce some of these biases and enhance alignment\nwith human choices.

We also identified a trade-off between preference diversity and\nalignment accuracy in LLMs, influenced by different temperature settings. Our\nfindings indicate that LLMs may lead to less diverse collective outcomes and\nbiased assumptions when used in voting scenarios, emphasizing the need for\ncautious integration of LLMs into democratic processes.",

In our model,\noptions are easier to compare when they involve less pronounced tradeoffs, in\nparticular when they are 1) more similar feature-by-feature and 2) closer to\ndominance. These two postulates yield tractable measures of comparison\ncomplexity in the domains of multiattribute, lottery, and intertemporal choice.\nWe show how our model organizes a range of behavioral regularities in choice\nand valuation, such as context effects, preference reversals, and apparent\nprobability weighting and hyperbolic discounting. We test our model\nexperimentally by varying the strength and nature of tradeoffs. First, we show\nthat our complexity measures predict choice errors, choice inconsistency, and\ncognitive uncertainty in binary choice data across all three domains. Second,\nwe document that manipulations of comparison complexity can reverse classic\nbehavioral regularities, in line with the predictions of the theory. We apply\nour theory to study strategic obfuscation by firms in a pricing game.",

The findings of this study confirm the MMI hypothesis. In\nparticular, it is observed that when 76% of educated parents choose to educate\ntheir daughters in the absence of educational programs, in contrast to only 37%\namong non-educated parents, the average impact of tuition fee subsidy on\nenrollment probability in primary schools stands at 3.8\\% for non-educated\nhouseholds and 0.27% for educated households. Conversely, in cases where only\n27% of educated parents decide to educate their daughters without education\nprograms, the average effect of tuition fee waivers on enrollment probability\nin primary schools increases to 19.64\\% for non-educated households and 24\\%\nfor educated households. From the analysis of household education decisions\ninfluenced by a preference for education and budget constraints, three key\nconclusions emerge to explain the mechanism behind the MMI. Firstly, when the\nincome advantage of educated households compared to non-educated households is\nsignificantly high, irrespective of the level of their preference advantage,\nreducing the financial cost of education induces a greater shift in education\ndecisions among non-educated households. Secondly, in situations where educated\nhouseholds do not possess an income advantage relative to non-educated\nhouseholds, the reduction in education-related financial costs leads to a more\npronounced change in education decisions among educated households. Lastly, for\nthe low-income advantage of educated households, as the income advantage of\neducated households increases, non-educated households respond more to\neducation policy than educated parents, if the preference advantage of educated\nhouseholds is relatively smaller.",

Efforts to boost\nAfrican farmers' agricultural production through fertilizer use can\ninadvertently promote the growth of aquatic vegetation that hosts disease\nvectors. Recent trials established that removing aquatic vegetation habitat for\nsnail intermediate hosts reduces schistosomiasis infection rates in children,\nwhile converting the harvested vegetation into compost boosts agricultural\nproductivity and incomes. Our model illustrates how this ecological\nintervention changes the feedback between the human and natural systems,\npotentially freeing rural households from poverty-disease traps. We develop a\nbioeconomic model that interacts an analytical microeconomic model of\nagricultural households' behavior, health status and incomes over time with a\ndynamic model of schistosomiasis disease ecology. We calibrate the model with\nfield data from northern Senegal. We show analytically and via simulation that\nlocal conversion of invasive aquatic vegetation to compost changes the\nfeedbacks among interlinked disease, aquatic and agricultural systems, reducing\nschistosomiasis infection and increasing incomes relative to the current status\nquo, in which villagers rarely remove vegetation. Aquatic vegetation removal\ndisrupts the poverty-disease trap by reducing habitat for snails that vector\nthe infectious helminth and by promoting production of compost that returns to\nagricultural soils nutrients that currently leach into surface water from\non-farm fertilizer applications. The result is healthier people, more\nproductive labor, cleaner water, more productive agriculture, and higher\nincomes.",

If we assume a parametric copula (other than independence) we\nobtain a full MLE, which is efficient but only under a correct copula\nspecification and may be biased if the copula is misspecified. Instead we\npropose a sieve MLE estimator (SMLE) which improves over QMLE but does not have\nthe drawbacks of full MLE. We model the unknown part of the joint distribution\nusing the Bernstein-Kantorovich polynomial copula and assess the resulting\nimprovement over QMLE and over misspecified FMLE in terms of relative\nefficiency and robustness. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the new\nestimator and show that it reaches the relevant semiparametric efficiency\nbound. Simulations suggest that the sieve MLE can be almost as efficient as\nFMLE relative to QMLE provided there is enough dependence between the\nmarginals. We demonstrate practical value of the new estimator with several\napplications. First, we apply SMLE in an insurance context where we build a\nflexible semi-parametric claim loss model for a scenario where one of the\nvariables is censored. As in simulations, the use of SMLE leads to tighter\nparameter estimates.

In the first two parts of the game, participants assume the roles\nof firms in a procurement market, where they must either adopt competitive\nbehaviors or have the option to engage in collusion. Success in these parts\nhinges on their comprehension of market dynamics. In the third part of the\ngame, participants transition to the role of competition-authority members.\nDrawing from recent literature on machine-learning-based cartel detection, they\nanalyze the bids for patterns indicative of collusive (cartel) behavior. In\nthis part of the game, success depends on data-science skills. We offer a\ndetailed discussion on implementing the game, emphasizing considerations for\naccommodating diverging levels of preexisting knowledge in data science.",

        "title": "Tacit algorithmic collusion in deep reinforcement learning guided price competition: A study using EV charge pricing game",
        "abstract": "Players in pricing games with complex structures are increasingly adopting\nartificial intelligence (AI) aided learning algorithms to make pricing\ndecisions for maximizing profits. This is raising concern for the antitrust\nagencies as the practice of using AI may promote tacit algorithmic collusion\namong otherwise independent players. Recent studies of games in canonical forms\nhave shown contrasting claims ranging from none to a high level of tacit\ncollusion among AI-guided players. In this paper, we examine the concern for\ntacit collusion by considering a practical game where EV charging hubs compete\nby dynamically varying their prices. Such a game is likely to be commonplace in\nthe near future as EV adoption grows in all sectors of transportation. The hubs\nsource power from the day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) electricity markets as\nwell as from in-house battery storage systems. Their goal is to maximize\nprofits via pricing and efficiently managing the cost of power usage. To aid\nour examination, we develop a two-step data-driven methodology. The first step\nobtains the DA commitment by solving a stochastic model. The second step\ngenerates the pricing strategies by solving a competitive Markov decision\nprocess model using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)\nframework. We evaluate the resulting pricing strategies using an index for the\nlevel of tacit algorithmic collusion. An index value of zero indicates no\ncollusion (perfect competition) and one indicates full collusion (monopolistic\nbehavior). Results from our numerical case study yield collusion index values\nbetween 0.14 and 0.45, suggesting a low to moderate level of collusion.",

MTRGL combines time series data and\ndiscrete features into a temporal graph and employs a memory-based temporal\ngraph neural network. This approach reframes temporal correlation\nidentification as a temporal graph link prediction task, which has shown\nempirical success. Our experiments on real-world datasets confirm the superior\nperformance of MTRGL, emphasizing its promise in refining automated pair\ntrading strategies.",

        "abstract": "We examine the contribution of Islamic legal institutions to the comparative\neconomic decline of the Middle East behind Latin Europe, which can be observed\nsince the late Middle Ages. To this end, we explore whether the sacralization\nof Islamic law and its focus on the Sharia as supreme, sacred and unchangeable\nlegal text, which reached its culmination in the 13th century had an impact on\neconomic development. We use the population size of 145 cities in Islamic\ncountries and 648 European cities for the period 800-1800 as proxies for the\nlevel of economic development, and construct novel estimates of the number of\nlaw schools (i.e. madaris) and estimate their contribution to the\npre-industrial economic development. Our triple-differences estimates show that\na higher density of madrasas before the sacralization of Islamic law predicts a\nmore vibrant urban economy characterized by higher urban growth. After the\nconsolidation of the sharia sacralization of law in the 13th century, greater\ndensity of law schools is associated with stagnating population size. We show\nthat the economic decline of the Middle East can be partly explained by the\nabsence of legal innovations or substitutes of them, which paved the way for\nthe economic rise of Latin Europe, where ground-breaking legal reforms\nintroduced a series of legal innovations conducive for economic growth. We find\nthat the number of learned lawyers trained in universities with law schools is\nhighly and positively correlated with the western European city population. Our\ncounterfactual estimates show that almost all Islamic cities under\nconsideration would have had much larger size by the year 1700 if legal\ninnovations comparable to those in Western Europe were introduced. By making\nuse of a series of synthetic control and difference-in-differences estimators\nour findings are robust against a large number of model specification checks.",

While statistical learning techniques like discrete\nchoice models have been used traditionally, machine learning (ML) models have\ngained traction recently among the transportation planners due to their higher\npredictive performance. However, the black box nature of ML models pose\nsignificant interpretability challenges, limiting their practical application\nin decision and policy making. This study utilised a dataset of $1350$\nhouseholds belonging to low and low-middle income bracket in the city of\nBengaluru to investigate mode choice decision making behaviour using\nMultinomial logit model and ML classifiers like decision trees, random forests,\nextreme gradient boosting and support vector machines. In terms of accuracy,\nrandom forest model performed the best ($0.788$ on training data and $0.605$ on\ntesting data) compared to all the other models. This research has adopted\nmodern interpretability techniques like feature importance and individual\nconditional expectation plots to explain the decision making behaviour using ML\nmodels. A higher travel costs significantly reduce the predicted probability of\nbus usage compared to other modes (a $0.66\\%$ and $0.34\\%$ reduction using\nRandom Forests and XGBoost model for $10\\%$ increase in travel cost). However,\nreducing travel time by $10\\%$ increases the preference for the metro ($0.16\\%$\nin Random Forests and 0.42% in XGBoost). This research augments the ongoing\nresearch on mode choice analysis using machine learning techniques, which would\nhelp in improving the understanding of the performance of these models with\nreal-world data in terms of both accuracy and interpretability.",

Strictly, GDP data should be in\nconstant prices to allow for its comparison over time, and material inputs to\nan economy should be the sum of mineral raw materials.

We check these new results\nby adding data for 1900-1990 to provide a longer time series, and find\nconsistently low (and even no) levels of global relative decoupling of material\nuse.

Nonfungible token (NFT) charity fundraisers, which involve the sale\nof NFTs of artistic works with the proceeds donated to philanthropic causes,\nhave emerged as a novel development in this space. A unique aspect of NFT\ncharity fundraisers is the significant potential for donors to reap financial\ngains from the rising value of purchased NFTs. Questions may arise about\ndonors' motivations in these charity fundraisers, potentially resulting in a\nnegative social image. NFT charity fundraisers thus offer a unique opportunity\nto understand the economic consequences of a donor's social image. We\ninvestigate these effects in the context of a large NFT charity fundraiser. We\nidentify the causal effect of purchasing an NFT within the charity fundraiser\non a donor's later market outcomes by leveraging random variation in\ntransaction processing times on the blockchain. Further, we demonstrate a clear\npattern of heterogeneity based on an individual's decision to relist (versus\nhold) the purchased charity NFTs (a sign of perceived strategic generosity) and\nbased on an individual's social exposure within the NFT marketplace. We show\nthat charity-NFT 're-listers' experience significant penalties in the market\nregarding the prices they can command for their other NFTs, particularly among\nthose who are more socially exposed. Finally, we report the results of a\nscenario-based online experiment, which again support our findings,\nhighlighting that the re-listing a charity NFT for sale at a profit leads\nothers to perceive their initial donation as strategic generosity and reduces\nthose others' willingness to purchase NFTs from the donor. Our study\nunderscores the growing importance of digital visibility and traceability,\nfeatures that characterize crypto-philanthropy, and online philanthropy more\nbroadly.",

However, not all online reviews are written by real consumers\nor reflect actual experiences, and present implications for consumers and\nbusinesses. This study examines the effects of fake online reviews written by\nartificial intelligence (AI) on consumer decision making.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to propose a novel model of the effects of\nchanges in shelter and driving costs on car commuting distances in the\noverheated Toronto housing market from 2011 to 2016. The model borrows from\ntheoretical concepts of microeconomics and urban geography to examine the\nToronto housing market. Using 2011 and 2016 Census data for census metropolitan\nareas (CMAs) and census agglomerations (CAs) in Southern Ontario and computed\ndriving costs, the model of car commuting distance is based on variables of\nallocation of monthly household income to monthly shelter costs and driving\ncosts as a function of the car driving distance to Toronto. Using this model,\nwe can predict the effect on car commuting distance due to changes in any of\nthe variables. The model also offers an explanation for communities of Toronto\ncar commuters beyond a driving radius that we might expect for daily commuting.\nThe model confirms that increases in shelter costs in the Toronto housing\nmarket from 2011 to 2016 have forced the boundaries of feasible housing\nlocations outward, and forced households to move farther away, thus increasing\ncar commuting distance.",

        "abstract": "Discrete choice models with social interactions or spillovers may exhibit\nmultiple equilibria. This paper provides a systematic approach to enumerating\nthem for a quantitative spatial model with discrete locations, social\ninteractions, and elastic housing supply. The approach relies on two\nhomotopies. A homotopy is a smooth function that transforms the solutions of a\nsimpler city where solutions are known, to a city with heterogeneous locations\nand finite supply elasticity. The first homotopy is that, in the set of cities\nwith perfectly elastic floor surface supply, an economy with heterogeneous\nlocations is homotopic to an economy with homogeneous locations, whose\nsolutions can be comprehensively enumerated. Such an economy is epsilon close\nto an economy whose equilibria are the zeros of a system of polynomials. This\nis a well-studied area of mathematics where the enumeration of equilibria can\nbe guaranteed. The second homotopy is that a city with perfectly elastic\nhousing supply is homotopic to a city with an arbitrary supply elasticity. In a\nsmall number of cases, the path may bifurcate and a single path yields two or\nmore equilibria. By running the method on thousands of cities, we obtain a\nlarge number of equilibria. Each equilibrium has different population\ndistributions. We provide a method that is computationally feasible for\neconomies with a large number of locations choices, with an empirical\napplication to the City of Chicago. There exist multiple ``counterfactual\nChicagos'' consistent with the estimated parameters. Population distribution,\nprices, and welfare are not uniquely pinned down by amenities. The paper's\nmethod can be applied to models in trade and IO. Further applications of\nalgebraic geometry are suggested.",

This tremendous\npotential raises two fundamental questions: (1) Will AI actually advance\nnational and global economic transformation to benefit society at large? and\n(2) What issues must we get right to fully realize AI's economic value, expand\nprosperity and improve lives everywhere? We explore these questions by\nconsidering the recent history of technology and innovation as a guide for the\nlikely impact of AI and what we must do to realize its economic potential to\nbenefit society. While we do not presume the future will be entirely like that\npast, for reasons we will discuss, we do believe prior experience with\ntechnological change offers many useful lessons.

We suggest a collective policy agenda - involving developers,\ndeployers and users of AI, infrastructure providers, policymakers, and those\ninvolved in workforce training - that may help both realize and harness AI's\neconomic potential and address its risks to our shared prosperity.",

        "abstract": "Currently, wind energy is one of the most important sources of renewable\nenergy. Offshore locations for wind turbines are increasingly exploited because\nof their numerous advantages. However, offshore wind farms require high\ninvestment in maintenance service. Due to its complexity and special\nrequirements, maintenance service is usually outsourced by wind farm owners. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel approach to determine, quantify, and reduce the\npossible conflicts of interest between owners and maintenance suppliers. We\ncreated a complete techno-economic model to address this problem from an\nimpartial point of view. An iterative process was developed to obtain\nstatistical results that can help stakeholders negotiate the terms of the\ncontract, in which the availability of the wind farm is the reference parameter\nby which to determine penalisations and incentives. Moreover, a multi-objective\nprogramming problem was addressed that maximises the profits of both parties\nwithout losing the alignment of their interests. The main scientific\ncontribution of this paper is the maintenance analysis of offshore wind farms\nfrom two perspectives: that of the owner and the maintenance supplier. This\nanalysis evaluates the conflicts of interest of both parties. In addition, we\ndemonstrate that proper adjustment of some parameters, such as penalisation,\nincentives, and resources, and adequate control of availability can help reduce\nthis conflict of interests.",

We\npropose a mechanistic model of trust that is grounded in the modern\nneuroscience of decision making. Since trust requires anticipating the future\nactions of others, any mechanistic model must be built upon up-to-date theories\non how the brain learns, represents, and processes information about the future\nwithin its decision-making systems. Contemporary neuroscience has revealed that\ndecision making arises from multiple parallel systems that perform distinct,\ncomplementary information processing. Each system represents information in\ndifferent forms, and therefore learns via different mechanisms. When an act of\ntrust is reciprocated or violated, this provides new information that can be\nused to anticipate future actions. The taxonomy of neural information\nrepresentations that is the basis for the system boundaries between neural\ndecision-making systems provides a taxonomy for categorizing different forms of\ntrust and generating mechanistic predictions about how these forms of trust are\nlearned and manifested in human behavior. Three key predictions arising from\nour model are (1) strategic risk-taking can reveal how to best proceed in a\nrelationship, (2) human organizations and environments can be intentionally\ndesigned to encourage trust among their members, and (3) violations of trust\nneed not always degrade trust, but can also provide opportunities to build\ntrust.",

The\nmaximum-entropy principle, which advocates for the consistent selection of the\nmost likely solution as a representative, is often used to address the\nchallenge. Built on a recently proposed day-to-day (DTD) discrete-time\ndynamical model called cumulative logit (CULO), this study provides a new\nbehavioral underpinning for the maximum-entropy UE (MEUE) route flow. It has\nbeen proven that CULO can reach a UE state without presuming travelers are\nperfectly rational. Here, we further establish that CULO always converges to\nthe MEUE route flow if (i) travelers have zero prior information about routes\nand thus are forced to give all routes an equal choice probability, or (ii) all\ntravelers gather information from the same source such that the so-called\ngeneral proportionality condition is satisfied. Thus, CULO may be used as a\npractical solution algorithm for the MEUE problem. To put this idea into\npractice, we propose to eliminate the route enumeration requirement of the\noriginal CULO model through an iterative route discovery scheme. We also\nexamine the discrete-time versions of four popular continuous-time dynamical\nmodels and compare them to CULO. The analysis shows that the replicator dynamic\nis the only one that has the potential to reach the MEUE solution with some\nregularity. The analytical results are confirmed through numerical experiments.",

Static\nanalysis shows that small price changes in one of the assets can result in\nlosses for liquidity providers. Despite the success of AMMs, it is claimed that\nliquidity providers often suffer losses. However, the literature does not\nadequately consider the dynamic effects of fees over time. Therefore, we\ninvestigate the impermanent loss problem in a dynamic setting using Monte Carlo\nsimulations. Our findings indicate that price changes do not necessarily lead\nto losses. Fees paid by traders and arbitrageurs are equally important. In this\nrespect, we can show that an arbitrage-friendly environment benefits the\nliquidity provider.

        "abstract": "This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as decision aids,\nwith a focus on their ability to learn preferences and provide personalized\nrecommendations. To establish a baseline, we replicate standard economic\nexperiments on choice under risk (Choi et al., 2007) with GPT, one of the most\nprominent LLMs, prompted to respond as (i) a human decision maker or (ii) a\nrecommendation system for customers. With these baselines established, GPT is\nprovided with a sample set of choices and prompted to make recommendations\nbased on the provided data. From the data generated by GPT, we identify its\n(revealed) preferences and explore its ability to learn from data. Our analysis\nyields three results. First, GPT's choices are consistent with (expected)\nutility maximization theory. Second, GPT can align its recommendations with\npeople's risk aversion, by recommending less risky portfolios to more\nrisk-averse decision makers, highlighting GPT's potential as a personalized\ndecision aid. Third, however, GPT demonstrates limited alignment when it comes\nto disappointment aversion.",

        "abstract": "Causal machine learning methods can be used to search for treatment effect\nheterogeneity in high-dimensional datasets even where we lack a strong enough\ntheoretical framework to select variables or make parametric assumptions about\ndata. This paper uses causal machine learning methods to estimate heterogeneous\ntreatment effects in the case of an experimental study carried out in Morocco\nwhich evaluated the effect of conditionalizing a cash transfer program on\nseveral outcomes including maths test scores which is the focus of this work.\nWe explore treatment effects across a dataset of 1936 pre-treatment variables.\nFor the most part, heterogeneity is modelled by two different factors,\nparticipation in education (at the baseline) and more general measures of\npoverty. Those who are more disadvantaged at the baseline benefit less from any\ntreatment. While conditioning generally has a negative effect this more\ndisadvantaged group is also hurt more by conditioning. The second purpose of\nthis paper is to demonstrate and reflect upon a causal machine learning\napproach to policy evaluation. We propose a novel causal tree method for\ninterpretable modelling of causal effects and reflect on the difficulty of\nexplaining atheoretical results.",

We examine the hypothesis\nof an inverted-U relationship between market concentration and fleet\nmodernization and find evidence that both the extremes of competition and\nconcentration may inhibit innovation adoption by carriers. We find limited\nevidence associating either hubbing activity or low-cost carriers with the more\nintense introduction of new types of aircraft models and variants in the\nindustry. Finally, our results suggest that energy cost rises may provoke\nboosts in fleet modernization in the long term, with carriers possibly\ntargeting more eco-efficient operations up to two years after an upsurge in\nfuel price.",

A recent example is the nationwide KlimaTicket in\nAustria, a country with a relatively high share of transport-related emissions.\nThe cheap yearly season ticket introduced in October 2021 allows unlimited\naccess to Austria's public transport network. Using the synthetic control and\nsynthetic difference-in-differences methods, I assess the causal effect of this\npolicy on public transport demand by constructing a data-driven counterfactual\nout of European railway companies to mimic the number of passengers of the\nAustrian Federal Railways without the KlimaTicket. The results indicate public\ntransport demand grew slightly faster in Austria, i.e., 3.3 or 6.8 percentage\npoints, depending on the method, than it would have in the absence of the\nKlimaTicket. However, the growth effect after the COVID-19 pandemic appears\nonly statistically significant when applying the synthetic control method, and\nthe positive effect on public transport demand growth disappears in 2022.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the interactions between selected coordination modes and\ndynamic team composition, and their joint effects on task performance under\ndifferent task complexity and individual learning conditions. Prior research\noften treats dynamic team composition as a consequence of suboptimal\norganizational design choices. The emergence of new organizational forms that\nconsciously employ teams that change their composition periodically challenges\nthis perspective. In this paper, we follow the contingency theory and\ncharacterize dynamic team composition as a design choice that interacts with\nother choices such as the coordination mode, and with additional contextual\nfactors such as individual learning and task complexity. We employ an\nagent-based modeling approach based on the NK framework, which includes a\nreinforcement learning mechanism, a recurring team formation mechanism based on\nsignaling, and three different coordination modes. Our results suggest that by\nimplementing lateral communication or sequential decision-making, teams may\nexploit the benefits of dynamic composition more than if decision-making is\nfully autonomous. The choice of a proper coordination mode, however, is partly\nmoderated by the task complexity and individual learning. Additionally, we show\nthat only a coordination mode based on lateral communication may prevent the\nnegative effects of individual learning.",

A comprehensive analysis of 2,521 startup\ninvestment deals, spanning from January 2019 to March 2023, was conducted using\na combination of statistical and several machine learning techniques. The\nresults of this study highlight a significant gender diversity gap, the\nimportance of professional experience, and the impact of founders' academic\nbackgrounds. The study reveals that human capital, a diversified sector\napproach, and cross-border collaboration strategies are crucial for a robust\nstartup ecosystem.

We study\nwhether there are significant gains from being a small or a large country in\nterms of certain socioeconomic indicators and how large this premium is. Using\npanel data for 200 countries over 50 years, we estimate premia for various\nsizes of nations across a variety of key economic and socioeconomic performance\nindicators. We find that smaller countries are richer, have larger governments,\nand are more prudent in terms of fiscal policies than larger ones. On the other\nhand, smaller countries seem to be subject to higher absolute and per capita\ncosts for the provision of essential public goods, which may lower their\nsocioeconomic performance in terms of health and education. In terms of\neconomic performance, small countries seem to do better than large countries,\ncompensating for smallness by relying on foreign trade and foreign direct\ninvestment. The latter comes at the cost of higher vulnerability to external\nshocks, resulting in higher volatility of growth rates. This paper's findings\noffer essential guidance to policymakers, international organizations, and\nbusiness researchers, especially those assessing a country's economic or\nsocioeconomic performance or potential. The study implies that comparisons with\nmedium-sized or large countries may be of little utility in predicting the\nperformance of small countries.",

PT Bank Jaya Artha is one of the Indonesian banks that\nprovide products and services for people who are set to enter retirement age.\nIn the wake of tight competition in the pension business market, Bank Jaya\nArtha has since 2019 imposed a fine of three times of installments in addition\nto 5% of outstanding debt on customers planning to repay their debt in a\nmission to prevent them from leaving for competitors. While the clause is not\nincluded in loan agreements signed before the implementation, it applies to\npast loan agreements as well. This, in turn, has led to customer complaints.\nThe research is meant to find out how the implementation of the unconsented\nclause has affected customer satisfaction and willingness to recommend the bank\nand what the bank should do to become more customer-centric, according to\ncustomers. Using a design thinking framework, the research collects\nquantitative and qualitative data from the bank's pension customers through\nquestionnaires and forum group discussions. Statistical analysis is utilized on\nquantitative data from questionnaires, and content analysis is utilized on\nqualitative data from questionnaires. A narrative analysis is also used to\nexplain qualitative data from forum group discussions. The result shows that\nthere are problems in the way the bank communicates information to customers,\nparticularly information about the loan repayment fine. Lack of transparency, a\nreactive approach instead of a proactive one, the obscurity of the information,\nand the time the information is delivered have affected customers' satisfaction\ntoward the bank.",

        "abstract": "This paper looks at a country's optimal central-government optimal policy in\na setting where its two identical local jurisdictions compete to attract\nfootloose multinationals to their sites, and where the considered\nmultinationals strictly prefer this country to the rest of the world. For the\nsake of realism the model allows the local jurisdictions to choose between\nfirm-specific and non-firm-specific policies. We show that the implementation\nof the jurisdictional firm-specific policy is weakly welfare dominant. Hence\nthe frequent calls for the central government to ban the former type of\npolicies go against the advice of this paper.",

At the same time, there is some tentative evidence suggesting that\noil rich nations tend to under-report data on income inequality, which can\npotentially influence the estimated empirical relationships between oil\nrichness and income inequality. In this paper we contribute to the literature\nin a twofold manner. First, we explore in depth the empirical relationship\nbetween oil and income inequality by making use of the Standardized World\nIncome Inequality Database; the most comprehensive dataset on income inequality\nproviding comparable data for the broadest set of country-year observations.\nSecond, this is the first study to our knowledge that adopts an empirical\nframework to examine whether oil rich nations tend to under-report data on\nincome inequality and the possible implications thereof. We make use of Heckman\nselection models to validate the tendency of oil rich countries to under-report\nand correct for the bias that might arise as a result of this; we find that oil\nis associated with lower income inequality with the exception of the very\noil-rich economies.",

Simply relying on aggregate measures or\nsummary statistics, such as the impact of average country temperature changes\non HICP headline inflation, conceals a large heterogeneity across (sub-)sectors\nof the economy. Additionally, the impact of a weather anomaly on consumer\nprices depends not only on its sign and magnitude, but also on its location and\nthe size of the area affected by the shock. This is especially true for larger\ncountries or regions with diverse climate zones, since the geographical\ndistribution of climatic effects plays a role in shaping economic outcomes.\nUsing time series data of geolocations, we demonstrate that relying solely on\ncountry averages fails to adequately capture and explain the influence of\nweather on consumer prices in the euro area.

More specifically,\nasset prices are more sensitive to the systematic economic news that impose a\npervasive effect on the whole market. Moreover, the investors will not be\nrewarded for bearing idiosyncratic risks as such risks are diversifiable. In\nthe paper Economic Forces and the Stock Market 1986, the authors introduced an\nattribution model to identify the specific systematic economic forces\ninfluencing the market. They first defined and examined five classic factors\nfrom previous research papers: Industrial Production, Unanticipated Inflation,\nChange in Expected Inflation, Risk Premia, and The Term Structure. By adding in\nnew factors, the Market Indices, Consumptions and Oil Prices, one by one, they\nexamined the significant contribution of each factor to the stock return. The\npaper concluded that the stock returns are exposed to the systematic economic\nnews, and they are priced with respect to their risk exposure. Also, the\nsignificant factors can be identified by simply adopting their model. Driven by\nsuch motivation, we conduct an attribution analysis based on the general\nframework of their model to further prove the importance of the economic\nfactors and identify the specific identity of significant factors.",

We developed an econometric model of the determinants of\npassenger satisfaction in a survey conducted at the largest airport in Latin\nAmerica, S\\~ao Paulo GRU Airport. Our focus was on the role of flight delays in\nthe perception of quality. The results of this study confirm the existence of a\nrelationship between flight delays and the global satisfaction of passengers\nwith airports. In addition, favorable evaluations regarding airports'\nfood/beverage concessions and Wi-Fi services, but not their retail options,\nhave a relevant moderating effect on that relationship. Furthermore,\ndissatisfaction arising from passengers' interaction with the airline can have\nnegative spillover effects on their satisfaction with the airport. We also\nfound evidence of blame-attribution behavior, in which only delays of internal\norigin, such as failures in flight management, are significant, indicating that\npassengers overlook weather-related flight delays. Finally, the results suggest\nthat an empirical specification that does not consider the latent\npsychosituational traits of passengers produces a relevant overestimation of\nthe absolute effect of flight delays on passenger satisfaction.",

Our goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the\nsignificance and interdependence of industry clusters in shaping the dynamics\nof GDP. To achieve a more nuanced spatial differentiation, we introduce\nindicator matrices for each industry sector which allows for extending the\nspatial Durbin model to a new version of it. This approach is essential due to\nboth the economic importance of these sectors and the potential issue of\nomitted variables.

To assess the effects of the major\nindustry sectors, we incorporate eight distinct branches of industry into our\nanalysis. According to prevailing economic theory, these clusters should have a\npositive impact on the regions they are associated with. Our findings indeed\nreveal highly significant impacts, which can be either positive or negative, of\nspecific sectors on local GDP growth. Spatially, we observe that direct and\nindirect effects can exhibit opposite signs, indicative of heightened\ncompetitiveness within and between industry sectors.

Over the 120 year period studied, the actualised impact of SLR\non the annual growth rate is between -0.02% and 0.04%. Extrapolating these\nfindings to future climate and socio-economic scenarios, we show that in the\nabsence of additional adaptation measures, GDP losses by 2100 could range\nbetween -6.3% and -20.8% under the most extreme SLR scenario (SSP5-RCP8.5\nHigh-end Ice, or -4.0% to -14.1% in SSP5-RCP8.5 High Ice). This statistical\nanalysis utilising a century-long dataset, provides an empirical foundation for\ndesigning region-specific climate adaptation strategies to mitigate economic\ndamages caused by SLR. Our evidence supports the argument for strategically\nrelocating assets and establishing coastal setback zones when it is\neconomically preferable and socially agreeable, given that protection\ninvestments have an economic impact.",

        "abstract": "Many online platforms of today, including social media sites, are two-sided\nmarkets bridging content creators and users. Most of the existing literature on\nplatform recommendation algorithms largely focuses on user preferences and\ndecisions, and does not simultaneously address creator incentives. We propose a\nmodel of content recommendation that explicitly focuses on the dynamics of\nuser-content matching, with the novel property that both users and creators may\nleave the platform permanently if they do not experience sufficient engagement.\nIn our model, each player decides to participate at each time step based on\nutilities derived from the current match: users based on alignment of the\nrecommended content with their preferences, and creators based on their\naudience size. We show that a user-centric greedy algorithm that does not\nconsider creator departures can result in arbitrarily poor total engagement,\nrelative to an algorithm that maximizes total engagement while accounting for\ntwo-sided departures. Moreover, in stark contrast to the case where only users\nor only creators leave the platform, we prove that with two-sided departures,\napproximating maximum total engagement within any constant factor is NP-hard.\nWe present two practical algorithms, one with performance guarantees under mild\nassumptions on user preferences, and another that tends to outperform\nalgorithms that ignore two-sided departures in practice.",

        "abstract": "Since the start of its national renaissance in 1970, the Sultanate of Oman\n(Oman) has gone over a major development in several areas, such as education,\ninfrastructure, and urbanization. This has been powered by the revenues from\nexporting crude oil and natural gas, which together form the skeleton of the\ncountry's economy. In the second half of 2014, the oil prices declined strongly\nto about 50% of its price. This was followed by another moderate decline in the\nsecond half of 2015 and the beginning of 2016, leaving the barrel price at a\nlow level below 30 US$ in January 2016 (as compared to above 110 US$ in June\n2014). This drop had direct impacts on the economy of Oman, manifested in a\nlarge budget deficit, reduced governmental expenditure, reduced or cancelled\nsubsidy of fuels and electricity, increase in the water tariff, and decline in\ndeposits in banks. The country is coping with this through its 9th five-year\nplan (2016-2020), which adopts a strategy of diversifying the income and\nrelying less on the traditional oil and gas sector. The country has also taken\nmeasures to facilitate private businesses. This article sheds light on these\ntopics as well as miscellaneous data about Oman.",

Real interest\nrates are negative about a third of the time and the real yield curves are\ninverted more than a third of the time, sometimes by substantial amounts. This\nrules out most of the standard bond pricing models, which are designed for\nnominal rates that are assumed to be positive. We therefore use the\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck model which allows negative rates and gives a good match to\ninversions of the yield curve. We derive the discount function using the method\nof Fourier transforms and fit it to the historical data. The estimated long\nterm discount rate is $1.7$ \\% for the UK and $2.2$ \\% for the US.

        "abstract": "Open defecation, which is linked with poor health outcomes, lower cognitive\nability and productivity, has been widespread in India. This paper assesses the\nimpact of a randomized norm-centric intervention implemented in peri-urban\nareas of Tamil Nadu in India on raising the value attached to residence in\nareas with a lower prevalence of open defecation, measured through Willingness\nto Pay (WTP). The intervention aimed to change social expectations about toilet\nusage through audio announcements, wall paintings, household visits, and\ncommunity meetings. The findings indicate a significant increase in the WTP for\nrelocating to areas with lower prevalence of open defecation. The results are\nconsistent when using local average treatment effect estimations wherein the\npossibility of spillovers in the control areas is accounted for. They are also\nrobust to potential bias due to local socio-political events during the study\nperiod and COVID-led attrition. We further observe a significant increase in\ntoilet ownership and usage. While assessing the mechanism, we find that change\nin empirical expectations through the intervention (what one believes about the\nprevalence of toilet usage in the community) is one of the primary mediating\nchannels. Normative expectations (what one believes about community approval of\ntoilet usage) are found to have limited effect. The findings underscore the\nneed for norm-centric interventions to propel change in beliefs and achieve\nlong-term and sustainable sanitation behavior.",

        "abstract": "Prevalence of open defecation is associated with adverse health effects,\ndetrimental not only for the individual but also the community. Therefore,\nneighborhood characteristics can influence collective progressive behavior such\nas improved sanitation practices. This paper uses primary data collected from\nrural and urban areas of Bihar to study the relationship between jati\n(sub-castes) level fractionalization within the community and toilet ownership\nand its usage for defecation. The findings indicate a diversity dividend\nwherein jati fractionalization is found to improve toilet ownership and usage\nsignificantly. While exploring the channels, we find social expectations to\nplay an important role, where individuals from diverse communities tend to\nbelieve that there is a higher prevalence of toilet usage within the community.\nTo assess the reasons for the existence of these social expectations, we use\ndata from an egocentric network survey on a sub-sample of the households. The\nfindings reveal that in fractionalized communities, the neighbors with whom our\nrespondents interacted are more likely to be from different jatis. They are\nalso more likely to use toilets and approve of its usage due to health reasons.\nDiscussions about toilets are more common among neighbors from fractionalized\ncommunities, which underscore the discernible role of social learning. The\ninferences drawn from the paper have significant implications for community\nlevel behavioral change interventions that aim at reducing open defecation.",

        "abstract": "As LLMs increasingly take on roles in human-AI interactions and autonomous AI\nsystems, understanding their social behavior becomes important for informed use\nand continuous improvement. However, their behaviors in social interactions\nwith humans and other agents, as well as the mechanisms shaping their\nresponses, remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel\nprobabilistic framework, State-Understanding-Value-Action (SUVA), to\nsystematically analyze LLM responses in social contexts based on their textual\noutputs (i.e., utterances). Using canonical behavioral economics games and\nsocial preference concepts relatable to LLM users, SUVA assesses LLMs' social\nbehavior through both their final decisions and the response generation\nprocesses leading to those decisions. Our analysis of eight LLMs -- including\ntwo GPT, four LLaMA, and two Mistral models -- suggests that most models do not\ngenerate decisions aligned solely with self-interest; instead, they often\nproduce responses that reflect social welfare considerations and display\npatterns consistent with direct and indirect reciprocity. Additionally,\nhigher-capacity models more frequently display group identity effects. The SUVA\nframework also provides explainable tools -- including tree-based\nvisualizations and probabilistic dependency analysis -- to elucidate how\nfactors in LLMs' utterance-based reasoning influence their decisions. We\ndemonstrate that utterance-based reasoning reliably predicts LLMs' final\nactions; references to altruism, fairness, and cooperation in the reasoning\nincrease the likelihood of prosocial actions, while mentions of self-interest\nand competition reduce them. Overall, our framework enables practitioners to\nassess LLMs for applications involving social interactions, and provides\nresearchers with a structured method to interpret how LLM behavior arises from\nutterance-based reasoning.",

Data annotation, encompassing the labelling of\nimages or annotating of texts by human workers, crucially influences the\nquality of a dataset directly influences the quality of AI models trained on\nit. This paper delves into the economics of data annotation, with a specific\nfocus on the impact of task instruction design (that is, the choice between\nrules and standards as theorised in law and economics) and monetary incentives\non data quality and costs. An experimental study involving 307 data annotators\nexamines six groups with varying task instructions (norms) and monetary\nincentives. Results reveal that annotators provided with clear rules exhibit\nhigher accuracy rates, outperforming those with vague standards by 14%.\nSimilarly, annotators receiving an additional monetary incentive perform\nsignificantly better, with the highest accuracy rate recorded in the group\nworking with both clear rules and incentives (87.5% accuracy). In addition, our\nresults show that rules are perceived as being more helpful by annotators than\nstandards and reduce annotators' difficulty in annotating images. These\nempirical findings underscore the double benefit of rule-based instructions on\nboth data quality and worker wellbeing. Our research design allows us to reveal\nthat, in our study, rules are more cost-efficient in increasing accuracy than\nmonetary incentives. The paper contributes experimental insights to discussions\non the economical, ethical, and legal considerations of AI technologies.\nAddressing policymakers and practitioners, we emphasise the need for a balanced\napproach in optimising data annotation processes for efficient and ethical AI\ndevelopment and usage.",

The study linked riparian land improvement to ecosystem\nservices and tested options for incorporating natural capital into financial\naccounting practices, specifically on the balance sheet. Methodology: To test\nthe approach, the study used a public asset manager (a water utility) with\naccountabilities to protect the environment including maintaining and enhancing\nriparian land assets. Research activities included stakeholder engagement,\nphysical asset measurement, monetary valuation and financial recognition of\nnatural capital income and assets. Natural capital income was estimated by\nmodelling and valuing ecosystem services relating to stormwater filtration and\ncarbon storage. Findings: This research described how a water utility could\ndisclose changes in the natural capital assets they manage either through\nvoluntary disclosures, in notes to the financial statements or as balance sheet\nitems. We found that current accounting standards allowed the recognition of\nsome types of environmental income and assets where ecosystem services were\nassociated with cost savings. The proof-of-concept employed to estimate\nenvironmental income through ecosystem service modelling proved useful to\nstrengthen sustainability claims or report financial returns on natural capital\ninvestment. Originality/value: This study applied financial accounting\nprocesses and principles to a realistic public asset management scenario with\ndirect participation by the asset manager working together with academic\nresearchers and a sub-national government environment management agency.\nImportantly it established that natural assets could be included in financial\nstatements, proposing a new approach to measuring and reporting on natural\ncapital.",

This paper aims to bridge this data gap by\nintroducing a comprehensive dataset spanning the years from 2016 to 2022,\nencompassing sales data, online reviews, and a wealth of information related to\nthe Chinese automotive industry. This dataset serves as a valuable resource,\nsignificantly expanding the available data. Its impact extends to various\ndimensions, including improving forecasting accuracy, expanding the scope of\nbusiness applications, informing policy development and regulation, and\nadvancing academic research within the automotive sector. To illustrate the\ndataset's potential applications in both business and academic contexts, we\npresent two application examples. Our developed dataset enhances our\nunderstanding of the Chinese automotive market and offers a valuable tool for\nresearchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders worldwide.",

        "abstract": "Emerging professions in fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and\nsustainability (green jobs) are experiencing labour shortages as industry\ndemand outpaces labour supply. In this context, our study aims to understand\nwhether employers have begun focusing more on individual skills rather than\nformal qualifications in their recruitment processes. We analysed a large\ntime-series dataset of approximately eleven million online job vacancies in the\nUK from 2018 to mid-2024, drawing on diverse literature on technological change\nand labour market signalling. Our findings provide evidence that employers have\ninitiated \"skill-based hiring\" for AI roles, adopting more flexible hiring\npractices to expand the available talent pool. From 2018-2023, demand for AI\nroles grew by 21% as a proportion of all postings (and accelerated into 2024).\nSimultaneously, mentions of university education requirements for AI roles\ndeclined by 15%. Our regression analysis shows that university degrees have a\nsignificantly lower wage premium for both AI and green roles. In contrast, AI\nskills command a wage premium of 23%, exceeding the value of degrees up until\nthe PhD-level (33%). In occupations with high demand for AI skills, the premium\nfor skills is high, and the reward for degrees is relatively low. We recommend\nleveraging alternative skill-building formats such as apprenticeships,\non-the-job training, MOOCs, vocational education and training,\nmicro-certificates, and online bootcamps to fully utilise human capital and\naddress talent shortages.",

This paper focuses on a specific case of market and\nnon-market goods, and investigates the optimal climate policy when social\npreference for them is also changed by climate policy in the DICE model. The\nrelative price of non-market goods grows over time due to increases in both\nrelative scarcity and appreciation of it. Therefore, climbing relative price\nbrings upward the social cost of carbon denominated in terms of market goods.\nBecause abatement decision affects the valuation of non-market goods in the\nutility function, unlike previous climate-economy models, we solve the model\niteratively by taking the obtained abatement rates from the last run as inputs\nin the current run. The results in baseline calibration advocate a more\nstringent climate policy, where endogenous social preference to climate policy\nraises the social cost of carbon further by roughly 12%-18% this century.\nMoreover, neglecting changing social preference leads to an underestimate of\nnon-market goods damages by 15%. Our results support that climate policy is\nself-reinforced if it favors more expensive consumption type.",

Furthermore, teams with a high proportion of exploitative\nprofiles tend to consolidate science, whereas those with a significant share of\nboth profiles tend to disrupt it. Cognitive diversity between team members\nappears to be always beneficial to combining more distant knowledge. However,\nto maximize the relevance of these distant combinations of knowledge,\nmaintaining a limited number of exploratory individuals is essential, as\nexploitative individuals must question and debate their novel perspectives.\nThese specialized individuals are the most qualified to extract the full\npotential of novel ideas and integrate them within the existing scientific\nparadigm.",

This paper analyses entrepreneurial intentions among final-year\nuniversity students after graduation in terms of the timeframe to start a\nbusiness. Potentially rapid entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs-in-waiting were\ncompared using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Methodology: A\nvariance-based structural equation modelling approach was used for the sample\nof 851 final-year university students with entrepreneurial intentions who\nparticipated in GUESSS project. Findings: The results obtained contribute to\nthe understanding of how entrepreneurial intentions are formed, particularly,\nhow intended timing plays a moderating role in the relationships of the\nvariables of the theoretical model of TPB. This study provides empirical\nevidence that significant differences exist between potential rapid\nentrepreneurs and entrepreneurs-in-waiting. Practical implications: The\nfindings of this study have practical implications for entrepreneurship\neducation, and they can help policy makers develop more effective policies and\nprograms to promote entrepreneurship. Originality: Intention-based models have\ntraditionally examined the intent -- but not the timing -- of new venture\ncreation. However, the time elapsed between the formation of the\nentrepreneurial intent and the identification of a business opportunity can\nvary considerably. Therefore, analysing the moderating role of intended timing\ncould be relevant to entrepreneurial intention research.",

The\nstudy aims to determine if Russian energy companies can maintain operations in\nthe solar energy sector without relying on direct state subsidies.\nMethodologically, the analysis utilizes established investment metrics such as\nNet Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Discounted Payback\nPeriod (DPP), tailored to reflect the unique technical and economic aspects of\nRussian solar energy facilities and to evaluate the influence of\nsector-specific risks on project efficiency, using a rating approach. We\nexamined eleven solar energy projects under ten different scenarios to\nunderstand the dynamics of direct state support, exploring variations in\nsupport cessation, reductions in financial assistance, and the projects'\nresilience to external risk factors. Our multi-criteria scenario assessment\nindicates that, under the prevailing market conditions, the Russian solar\nenergy sector is not yet equipped to operate efficiently without ongoing state\nfinancial subsidies. Interestingly, our findings also suggest that the solar\nenergy sector in Russia has a greater potential to reduce its dependence on\nstate support compared to the wind energy sector. Based on these insights, we\npropose energy policy recommendations aimed at gradually minimizing direct\ngovernment funding in the Russian renewable energy market. This strategy is\ndesigned to foster self-sufficiency and growth in the solar energy sector.",

To that end, a purposive sample of 142\nparticipants was recruited to complete an online quantitative approach based\nsurvey. The survey consisted of a modified and previously validated measure of\nacceptance based on the extended demographic version of the unified theory of\nacceptance and use of technology), as well as usage scale items. The empirical\nfindings confirm that participants were generally accepting of Property\ntechnology in the Vietnamese real estate market.

The usage of Property technology was slightly more concerned with the\ngathering of information on properties and markets than transactions or\nportfolio management. This study provides an in depth understanding of Property\ntechnology for firms' managers and marketers. Online social interactions might\nbe either harmful or fruitful for firms depending on the type of interaction\nand engagement behavior. This is especially true of property portals and social\nmedia forums that would help investors to connect, communicate and learn.\nFindings can help users to improve their strategies for digital marketing.

Discounting future benefits and costs of climate change\nmitigation is one of the most critical components of assessing efficient\nclimate mitigation pathways. We extend the DICE model with stochastic discount\nrates to reflect the uncertain nature of discount rates. Stochastic rates give\nrise to a stochastic mitigation strategy, resulting in all model quantities\nbecoming stochastic.\n  We show that the classical calibration of the DICE model induces\nintergenerational inequality: future generations have to bear higher costs\nrelative to GDP. Further, we show that considering stochastic discount rates\nand stochastic abatement policies, which can be interpreted as successive\nre-calibration, increases intergenerational inequality (and adds additional\nrisks). Motivated by this, we consider additional financing risks by\ninvestigating two modifications of DICE. We find that allowing financing of\nabatement costs and considering non-linear financing effects for large damages\nimproves intergenerational effort sharing. To conclude our discussion of\noptions to improve intergenerational equity in an IAM, we propose a modified\noptimization to keep costs below 3% of GDP, resulting in more equal\ndistribution of efforts between generations.",

By constantly and\npassively quoting, the dealers influence their own wealth but also have\nramifications on the market as a whole and the other participating agents.\nThrough synthetic market simulations, the optimal behaviour of different dealer\nstrategies and their consequences on market dynamics are examined. The analysis\nreveals that dealers exhibiting greater risk aversion tend to yield better\nperformance outcomes. The choice of quote sizes by dealers is\nstrategy-dependent: one strategy demonstrates enhanced performance with larger\nquote sizes, whereas the other strategy show a better results with smaller\nones. Increasing quote size shows positive influence on the market in terms of\nvolatility and kurtosis with both dealer strategies. However, the impact\nstemming from larger risk aversion is mixed. While one of the dealer strategies\nshows no discernible effect, the other strategy results in mixed outcomes,\nencompassing both positive and negative effects.",

        "abstract": "Contact tracing is one of the most important tools for preventing the spread\nof infectious diseases, but as the experience of COVID-19 showed, it is also\nnext-to-impossible to implement when the disease is spreading rapidly. We show\nhow to substantially improve the efficiency of contact tracing by combining\nstandard microeconomic tools that measure heterogeneity in how infectious a\nsick person is with ideas from machine learning about sequential optimization.\nOur contributions are twofold. First, we incorporate heterogeneity in\nindividual infectiousness in a multi-armed bandit to establish optimal\nalgorithms. At the heart of this strategy is a focus on learning. In the\ntypical conceptualization of contact tracing, contacts of an infected person\nare tested to find more infections. Under a learning-first framework, however,\ncontacts of infected persons are tested to ascertain whether the infected\nperson is likely to be a \"high infector\" and to find additional infections only\nif it is likely to be highly fruitful. Second, we demonstrate using three\nadministrative contact tracing datasets from India and Pakistan during COVID-19\nthat this strategy improves efficiency. Using our algorithm, we find 80% of\ninfections with just 40% of contacts while current approaches test twice as\nmany contacts to identify the same number of infections. We further show that a\nsimple strategy that can be easily implemented in the field performs at nearly\noptimal levels, allowing for, what we call, feasible contact tracing. These\nresults are immediately transferable to contact tracing in any epidemic.",

Two complementary\nresearch goals are formulated. Firstly, investigating economic linkages of the\nSwedish air transport sector. Secondly, estimating the effects of the pandemic\non Swedish air transport, and the spin-off effects on the economy as a whole.\nOverview of literature in the field reveals that while a fair amount of\nresearch exists on the importance of air transport, unsurprisingly, pandemic\neffects have yet to be investigated. The methodological framework chosen is\ninput-output analysis, thus, the backbone of data materials used is the Swedish\ninput-output table, complemented by additional datasets. For measuring economic\nlinkages, basic input-output analysis is applied. Meanwhile, to capture the\npandemic's impacts, a combination of inoperability analysis and the partial\nhypothetical extraction model is implemented. It is found that while Swedish\nair transport plays an important role in turning the cogs of the Swedish\neconomy, when compared to all other sectors, it ranks on the lower end.\nFurthermore, while the COVID-19 pandemic has a detrimental short-term impact on\nSwedish air transport, the spin-off effects for the economy as a whole are\nmilder. It is concluded, that out of a value-added perspective, the Swedish\ngovernment, and by extension policy makers globally need not support failing\nairlines, and other air transport actors. Nonetheless, some aspects could not\nbe captured through the methods used, such as the possible importance of\nairlines to national security at times of dodgy global cooperation. Lastly, to\naccurately capture not only short-term, but also long-term effects of the\npandemic, future research using alternative, causality-based frameworks and\ndynamic input-output models will be highly beneficial.",

It is\nfound that sectors most embedded into global value chains will drive economic\nimpacts, hence special attention is paid to the international trade\nperspective. When it comes to the path towards transformative AI, research is\nheterogenous in its predictions, with some predicting rapid, unhindered\nadoption, and others taking a more conservative view based on potential\nbottlenecks and comparisons to past disruptive technologies. As for wealth\ncreation, while some agreement is to be found in AI's growth boosting\nabilities, predictions on timelines are lacking. Consensus exists however\naround the dispersion of AI induced wealth, which is heavily biased towards\ndeveloped countries due to phenomena such as anchoring and reduced bargaining\npower of developing countries. Finally, a shortcoming of economic growth models\nin failing to consider AI risk is discovered. Based on the review, a\ncalculated, and slower adoption rate of AI technologies is recommended.",

While prior research has\ninvestigated the effect of information technology in general on human labor\nfrom a macro perspective, this paper complements the literature by examining\nthe impact of LLMs on freelancers from a micro perspective. Specifically, we\nleverage the release of ChatGPT to investigate how AI influences freelancers\nacross different online labor markets (OLMs). Employing the\nDifference-in-Differences method, we discovered two distinct scenarios\nfollowing ChatGPT's release: 1) the displacement effect of LLMs, featuring\nreduced work volume and earnings, as is exemplified by the translation &\nlocalization OLM; 2) the productivity effect of LLMs, featuring increased work\nvolume and earnings, as is exemplified by the web development OLM. To shed\nlight on the underlying mechanisms, we developed a Cournot-type competition\nmodel to highlight the existence of an inflection point for each occupation\nwhich separates the timeline of AI progress into a honeymoon phase and a\nsubstitution phase. Before AI performance crosses the inflection point, human\nlabor benefits each time AI improves, resulting in the honeymoon phase.\nHowever, after AI performance crosses the inflection point, additional AI\nenhancement hurts human labor. Further analyzing the progression from ChatGPT\n3.5 to 4.0, we found three effect scenarios (i.e., productivity to\nproductivity, displacement to displacement, and productivity to displacement),\nconsistent with the inflection point conjecture. Heterogeneous analyses reveal\nthat U.S. web developers tend to benefit more from the release of ChatGPT\ncompared to their counterparts in other regions, and somewhat surprisingly,\nexperienced translators seem more likely to exit the market than less\nexperienced translators after the release of ChatGPT.",

Results demonstrate that, under high VRES\npenetration levels (e.g., 40%), our framework can significantly reduce system\ncosts and market-price volatility, by optimizing VRES quantities efficiently in\nthe day-ahead market. Furthermore, we find that when transmission capacity\nincreases, the proposed bilevel model will still reduce the system cost,\nwhereas the myopic strategy may incur a much higher cost due to over-scheduling\nof VRES in the day-ahead market and the lack of flexible conventional\ngenerators in real time.",

        "abstract": "Tourism's increasing share of Gross Domestic Product throughout the world,\nits impact on employment and its continuous growth justifies the interest it\nraises amongst entrepreneurs and public authorities. However, this growth\ncoexists with intense competition; as a result of which, tourism companies must\ncontinuously innovate in order to survive and grow. This is evident in the\ndiversification of tourism products and destinations, the improvement of\nbusiness processes and the incorporation of new technologies for\nintermediation, amongst other examples. This paper expounds on the factors that\nexplain the propensity for innovation amongst tourism entrepreneurs and it may\nhelp governments to promote innovation that is based on those determining\nfactors. The hypotheses are tested using a logistic regression on 699\ninternational tourism entrepreneurs, taken from the 2014 Global Adult\nPopulation Survey of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor project. The\npropensity for innovation amongst tourism entrepreneurs has a statistically\nsignificant relationship to gender, age, level of education and informal\ninvestments in previous businesses.",

        "abstract": "Among the main causes of absenteeism are health problems, emotional problems,\nand inadequate work-family policies (WFP). This paper analyses the impact of\nthe existence and accessibility of WFP on work absenteeism, by considering the\nmediating role of the well-being, which includes emotional as well as physical\nor health problems, that is generated by these policies. We differentiate\nbetween the existence of the WFP and its accessibility, as the mere existence\nof the WFP in an organisation is not enough. Additionally, workers must be able\nto access these policies easily and without retaliation of any kind. The model\nincludes the hierarchy and the gender as moderating variables. To test the\nproposed hypotheses, a structural equation model based on the partial least\nsquares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach is applied to a sample\nof employees in the service sector in Spain. On the one hand, the findings show\nthat the existence of WFP has no direct effect on absenteeism; however,\naccessibility to these policies does have a direct effect on absenteeism. On\nthe other hand, both the existence and accessibility of WFP have positive\ndirect effects on emotional well-being. In addition, emotional well-being is\npositively related to physical well-being which, in turn, promotes a reduction\nin absenteeism. Finally, significant differences in the relationship between\nthe existence of WFP and emotional well-being confirm the special difficulty of\nfemale managers in reconciling family life and work life.",

In our model, a principal hires a risk-averse agent to carry out a\nproject. Specifically, the agent can perform two different tasks, namely to\nincrease the instantaneous growth rate of the project's value, and to reduce\nthe likelihood of accidents occurring. In order to compensate for these costly\nactions, the principal offers a continuous stream of payments throughout the\nentire duration of a contract, which concludes at a random time, potentially\nresulting in a lump-sum payment. We examine the consequences stemming from the\nintroduction of accidents, modelled by a compound Poisson process that\nnegatively impact the project's value. Furthermore, we investigate whether\ncertain economic scenarii are still characterised by a golden parachute as in\nSannikov's model. A golden parachute refers to a situation where the agent\nstops working and subsequently receives a compensation, which may be either a\nlump-sum payment leading to termination of the contract or a continuous stream\nof payments, thereby corresponding to a pension.",

        "abstract": "Is emotional well-being monotonically increasing in the level of income or\ndoes it reach a plateau at some income threshold, whereafter additional income\ndoes not contribute to further well-being? Conflicting answers to this question\nhas been suggested in the academic literature. In a recent paper, using an\nincome threshold of $100,000 per year, Killingsworth et al. (2023) appears to\nhave resolved these conflicts, concluding that emotional well-being is\nmonotonically increasing in income for all but the unhappiest individuals. In\nthis paper, we show that this conclusion is sensitive to the placement of the\nincome threshold at which the relationship between emotional well-being and\nincome is allowed to plateau. Using standard econometric methods, we propose a\ndata-driven approach to detect the placement of the threshold. Using this\ndata-driven income threshold, a flat relationship between household income and\nemotional well-being above a threshold around $200,000 per year is found. While\nour analysis relaxes the assumption of a pre-specified income threshold, it\nrelies on a number of other assumptions, which we briefly discuss. We conclude\nthat although the analysis of this paper provides some evidence for well-being\nplateauing around $200,000 per year, more research is needed before any\ndefinite conclusions about the relationship between emotional well-being and\nincome can be drawn.",

        "abstract": "The tourism sector is a sector with many opportunities for business\ndevelopment. Entrepreneurship in this sector promotes economic growth and job\ncreation. Knowing how entrepreneurial intention develops facilitates its\ntransformation into entrepreneurial behaviour. Entrepreneurial behaviour can\nadopt a causal logic, an effectual logic or a combination of both. Considering\nthe causal logic, decision-making is done through prediction. In this way,\nentrepreneurs try to increase their market share by planning strategies and\nanalysing possible deviations from their plans. Previous literature studies\ncausal entrepreneurial behaviour, as well as variables such as creative\ninnovation, proactive decisions and entrepreneurship training when the\nentrepreneur has already created his or her firm. However, there is an obvious\ngap at a stage prior to the start of entrepreneurial activity when the\nentrepreneurial intention is formed. This paper analyses how creativity,\nproactivity, entrepreneurship education and the propensity for causal behaviour\ninfluence entrepreneurial intentions. To achieve the research objective, we\nanalysed a sample of 464 undergraduate tourism students from two universities\nin southern Spain. We used SmartPLS 3 software to apply a structural equation\nmethodology to the measurement model composed of nine hypotheses. The results\nshow, among other relationships, that causal propensity, entrepreneurship\nlearning programmes and proactivity are antecedents of entrepreneurial\nintentions. These findings have implications for theory, as they fill a gap in\nthe field of entrepreneurial intentions. Considering propensity towards causal\nbehaviour before setting up the firm is unprecedented. Furthermore, the results\nof this study have practical implications for the design of public education\npolicies and the promotion of business creation in the tourism sector.",

The market is\ncomposed of multiple risky assets and multiple consumption goods, while in\naddition there are multiple fluctuating preference parameters with inexact\nvalues connected to imprecise tastes. Utility maximization is a multi-criteria\nproblem with possibly function-valued criteria. To come up with a complete\ncharacterization of the solutions, first we motivate and introduce a set-valued\nstochastic process for the dynamics of multi-utility indices and formulate the\noptimization problem in a topological vector space. Then, we modify a classical\nscalarization method allowing for infiniteness and randomness in dimensions and\nprove results of equivalence to the original problem. Illustrative examples are\ngiven to demonstrate practical interests and method applicability\nprogressively. The link between the original problem and a dual problem is also\ndiscussed, relatively briefly. Finally, using Malliavin calculus with\nstochastic geometry, we find optimal investment policies to be generally\nset-valued, each of whose selectors admits a four-way decomposition involving\nan additional indecisiveness risk-hedging portfolio. Our results touch on new\ndirections for optimal consumption--investment choices in the presence of\nincomparability and time inconsistency, also signaling potentially testable\nassumptions on the variability of asset prices. Simulation techniques for\nset-valued processes are studied for how solved optimal policies can be\ncomputed in practice.",

This paper turns to NFT markets, where\nthe on-chain nature of transactions-a key tenet of Web3 innovation-enables more\ndirect estimation methods to be applied. Focusing on three of the largest NFT\nmarketplaces, we find 30-40% of NFT volume and 25-95% of traded value involve\nwash trading. We leverage this direct approach to critically evaluate recent\nindirect estimation methods suggested in the literature, revealing major\ndifferences in effectiveness, with some failing altogether. Trade-roundedness\nfilters, as suggested in Cong et al. (2023), emerge as the most accurate\nindirect estimation method. In fact, we show how direct and indirect approaches\ncan be closely aligned via hyper-parameter fine-tuning. Our findings underscore\nthe crucial role of technological innovation in detecting and regulating\nfinancial misconduct in digital finance.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the research paper is to understand the sustainability challenges\nfaced by resorts mainly luxury in Maldives and to implement the sustainable\ntourism practices. The Maldives economy is dependent mostly on the fishing,\nboat building, boat repairing and tourism. Over recent years there is a drastic\nchange that has took place in Maldives in tourism industry. Maldives has\nprogressed to be the upper middle-income country and luxury resorts are the\nreason for increased GDP in the country. Although there are some practices\nassociated with the luxury resorts to follow in terms of environmental\nconcerns. Present study focuses on the triple bottom line approach and the 12\nmajor Sustainable Tourism Principles as a framework for sustainability\npractices and its implementation including the challenges associated in\nMaldives. The paper suggests some recommendations on several paradigm of\nenforcing laws and regulations, waste management facilities, fostering\ncollaboration along with promoting local agriculture. The study also\ncontemplates on several other areas such as on the impact of sustainability\ninitiatives, coral restoration, and the use of sustainable supply chains. The\nintent of the current research is to suggest methods to promote the sustainable\npractices in luxury resort in Maldives.",

        "abstract": "Recently, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) has become an important\nfactor in companies' sustainable development. Artificial intelligence (AI) is\nalso a core digital technology that can create innovative, sustainable,\ncomprehensive, and resilient environments. ESG- and AI-based digital\ntransformation is a relevant strategy for managing business value and\nsustainability in corporate green management operations. Therefore, this study\nexamines how corporate sustainability relates to ESG- and AI-based digital\ntransformation. Furthermore, it confirms the moderating effect of green\ninnovation on the process of increasing sustainability. To achieve the purpose\nof this study, 359 data points collected for hypothesis testing were used for\nstatistical analysis and for mobile business platform users. The following\nconclusions are drawn. (1) ESG activities have become key variables that enable\nsustainable corporate growth. Companies can implement eco-friendly operating\nprocesses through ESG activities. (2) This study verifies the relationship\nbetween AI-based digital transformation and corporate sustainability and\nconfirms that digital transformation positively affects corporate\nsustainability. In addition, societal problems can be identified and\nenvironmental accidents prevented through technological innovation. (3) This\nstudy does not verify the positive moderating effect of green innovation;\nhowever, it emphasizes its necessity and importance. Although green innovation\nimproves performance only in the long term, it is a key factor for companies\npursuing sustainable growth. This study reveals that ESG- and AI-based digital\ntransformation is an important tool for promoting corporate sustainability,\nbroadening the literature in related fields and providing insights for\ncorporate management and government policymakers to advance corporate\nsustainability.",

The study involved a behavioral experiment that included a\npre-test questionnaire, blind tasting of honey samples, an in-room test to\nassess perceived quality, and a closed auction using the\nBecker-DeGroote-Marschak method. As the result, it was revealed that the\ncorrespondence of the expected sensations to the actual taste, taste intensity,\nduration of the aftertaste and the sensations of tickling in the throat had a\npositive effect on both the perceived quality of the product and the\nwillingness to pay for it, while perception of off-flavors or added sugar had a\nnegative impact.

        "abstract": "Trapping refers to the event when a household falls into the area of poverty.\nHouseholds that live or fall into the area of poverty are said to be in a\npoverty trap, where a poverty trap is a state of poverty from which it is\ndifficult to escape without external help. Similarly, extreme poverty is\nconsidered as the most severe type of poverty, in which households experience\nsevere deprivation of basic human needs. In this article, we consider an Omega\nrisk process with deterministic growth and a multiplicative jump (collapse)\nstructure to model the capital of a household. It is assumed that, when a\nhousehold's capital level is above a certain capital barrier level that\ndetermines a household's eligibility for a capital cash transfer programme, its\ncapital grows exponentially. As soon as its capital falls below the capital\nbarrier level, the capital dynamics incorporate external support in the form of\ndirect transfers (capital cash transfers) provided by donors or governments.\nOtherwise, once trapped, the capital grows only due to the capital cash\ntransfers. Under this model, we first derive closed-form expressions for the\ntrapping probability and then do the same for the probability of extreme\npoverty, which only depends on the current value of the capital given by some\nextreme poverty rate function. Numerical examples illustrate the role of\ncapital cash transfers on poverty and extreme poverty dynamics.",

A key challenge lies in determining the optimal spatial\ncapacity allocation of offshore wind parks in combination with the dimensioning\nand layout of the connecting high-voltage direct current grid infrastructure.\nTo determine economically cost optimal configurations, we apply an integrated\ncapacity and transmission expansion problem within a pan-European electricity\nmarket and transmission grid model with a high spatial and temporal\ngranularity. By conducting scenario analysis for the year 2030 with a gradually\nincreasing CO2 price, possible offshore expansion paths are derived and\npresented. Special emphasis is laid on the effects of weather uncertainty by\nincorporating data from 21 historical weather years in the analysis. Two key\nfindings are (i) an expansion in addition to the existing offshore wind\ncapacity of 0 GW (136 EUR/tCO2), 12 GW (159 EUR/tCO2) and 30 GW (186 EUR/tCO2)\ndependent on the underlying CO2 price.

Leveraging exogenous variation from untaxed Northern-German\nconsumers, we employ a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the\ncausal effects of both the implementation and repeal of the tax on consumption\nand expenditure behavior across eight product categories targeted by the tax.\nOur findings reveal significant heterogeneity in the tax's impact across these\nproducts. During the taxed period, there was a notable decline in consumption\nof bacon, liver sausage, and cheese, particularly among low-income households.\nIn contrast, expenditure on butter, cream, and margarine increased as prices\nrose. Interestingly, we do not observe any difference in expenditure increases\nbetween high and low-income households, suggesting that the latter were\ndisproportionately affected by the tax. After the repeal of the tax, we do not\nobserve any significant decline in consumption. On the contrary, there was an\noverall increase in consumption for certain products, prompting concerns about\nunintended consequences resulting from the brief implementation of the tax.\nFinally, we find strong evidence on an overall increase purchases of butter\nabroad for households living less than 50 km from the German boarder but we do\nnot find strong evidence of spatial heterogeneous effects of the tax.",

The developed tool is applied to\nevaluate different research questions: i) pathway towards full decarbonization\nand power self-sufficiency of the electricity sector in Italy, ii) relevance of\nflexibility assets in power grids: li-ion batteries, hydrogen storage and\ntransmission lines reinforcement. A 55% CO2 emissions reduction for the actual\nItalian power sector can be achieved through an increase of 30% of the total\nannual system cost.

Furthermore, we pay\nattention to the vital role of the government policy in distributing tax\ncredits. Instead of uniform distribution considered in state-of-the-art, it\nrequires a well-designed strategy to reduce disparities among households and\nimprove social welfare. To address these limitations, we propose an expansive\nmulti-agent economic model comprising reinforcement learning agents of numerous\ntypes. Additionally, our research comprehensively explores the impact of tax\ncredit allocation on household behavior and captures the spectrum of spending\npatterns that can be observed across diverse households. Further, we propose an\ninnovative government policy to distribute tax credits, strategically\nleveraging insights from tax credit spending patterns.

Specifically, a 1{\\deg}C warming\nof sea surface temperature in the tropical Pacific Ocean, a proxy for a\nmoderate-strength El Ni\\~no event, reduces political violence in exposed\nlocations with crop agriculture, relative to other areas, by approximately\nthree percent, during the early postharvest season.

This effect can be five times as large\nafter a strong El Ni\\~no event, such as that of 1997 or 2015, in highly exposed\ncroplands, such as parts of Southern Africa and the Sahel. Conversely, a La\nNi\\~na event, which is a counterpart of an El Ni\\~no event, has the opposite\neffect and thus increases conflict in the exposed croplands during the early\npostharvest season. Because ENSO events can be predicted at least several\nmonths in advance, these findings can contribute to creating a platform for\nearly warnings of changes in political violence in predominantly agrarian\nsocieties.",

        "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) is integrated into various services and\nsystems in society, many companies and organizations have proposed AI\nprinciples, policies, and made the related commitments. Conversely, some have\nproposed the need for independent audits, arguing that the voluntary principles\nadopted by the developers and providers of AI services and systems\ninsufficiently address risk. This policy recommendation summarizes the issues\nrelated to the auditing of AI services and systems and presents three\nrecommendations for promoting AI auditing that contribute to sound AI\ngovernance. Recommendation1.Development of institutional design for AI audits.\nRecommendation2.Training human resources for AI audits. Recommendation3.\nUpdating AI audits in accordance with technological progress.\n  In this policy recommendation, AI is assumed to be that which recognizes and\npredicts data with the last chapter outlining how generative AI should be\naudited.",

In parallel, we propose\nto consider the sentiment around main entities of an article as a more accurate\nproxy for the overall sentiment of such piece of text, and describe a\ncase-study to motivate this choice. Finally, we design features that\ncharacterise the type and structure of news within each week, and map them to\nmoments of financial markets dislocations. The latter are identified as dates\nwith unusually high volatility across asset classes, and we find quantitative\nevidence that they relate to instances of high entropy in the high-dimensional\nspace of interconnected news. This result further motivates the pursued efforts\nto provide a novel framework for the systematic analysis of narratives within\nnews.",

This paper aims to analyze the\nimpact of WFP accessibility and organizational support on well-being directly\nand by mediating the organizational commitment that these policies might\nencourage. In addition, we also study whether these relationships vary\naccording to gender and employee seniority. To test the hypotheses derived from\nthis objective, we collected 530 valid and completed questionnaires from\nworkers in the tourism sector in Spain, which we analyzed using structural\nequation modeling based on the PLS-SEM approach. The results show that human\nresource management must consider the importance of organizational support for\nworkers to make WFP accessible and generate organizational commitment and\nwell-being at work.",

However, for many emerging economies like China, the\nequalization level of basic public services may often be neglected in the\ntrade-off between the speed and quality of development. Taking the Yangtze\nRiver Delta region of China as an example, this paper first adopts the coupling\ncoordination degree model to explore current status of basic public services in\nthis region, and then uses Moran's I index to study the overall equalization\nlevel of development there. Moreover, this paper uses the Theil index to\nanalyze the main reasons for the spatial differences in the level of public\nservices, followed by the AF method to accurately identify the exact weaknesses\nof the 40 counties of 10 cities with the weakest level of basic public service\ndevelopment. Based on this, this paper provides targeted optimization\ninitiatives and continues to explore the factors affecting the growth of the\nlevel of public service equalization through the convergence model, verifying\nthe convergence trend of the degree of public service equalization, and\nultimately providing practical policy recommendations for promoting the\nequalization of basic public services.",

To accomplish this, it is\nnecessary to establish implementation concepts that detail the timing,\nlocation, and specific measures required to achieve decarbonization. This\nrestructuring process involves identifying the measures that offer the most\ncompelling techno-economic and ecological advantages. In particular, measures\nthat contribute to the interconnection of energy vectors and domains, e.g.\nheating, cooling, and electricity supply, in the sense of decentralized\nmulti-energy systems are a promising future development option. Due to the high\ncomplexity resulting from a multitude of decision options as well as a temporal\ncoupling across the transformation path, the use of optimization methods is\nrequired, which enable a bottom-up identification of suitable transformation\nsolutions in a high spatial resolution. For the design of reasonable concepts,\nwe develop a multistage optimization problem for the derivation of\ntransformation pathways in the context of a multi-location structure,\nexpansion, and operation problem. The results show that the heat supply in the\nfuture will mainly be provided by heat pumps with a share of 60%.

We hypothesize that insurance sector growth positively propels economic\ngrowth due to its economic growth-supportive traits like investment protection\nand optimal risk mitigation. We also claim that Nighttime light data is a good\neconomic measure than Gross domestic product (GDP). We used weighted\nregressions to measure the relationships between nighttime light data, GDP, and\ninsurance sector development. We used time series South African GDP data\ncollected from the World Bank for the period running from 2000 to 2018, and the\nnighttime lights data from the National Geophysical Data Centre (NGDC) in\npartnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\nFrom the models fitted and the reported BIC, AIC, and likelihood ratios, the\ninsurance sector proved to have more predictive power on economic development\nin South Africa, and radiance light explained economic growth better than GDP\nand GDP/Capita. We concluded that nighttime data is a good proxy for economic\ngrowth than GDP/Capita in emerging economies like South Africa, where secondary\ndata needs to be more robust and sometimes inflated. The findings will guide\nresearchers and policymakers on what drives economic development and what\npolicies to put in place.

Consequently,\ndecision-makers are taking proactive measurements to promote diversity,\nunderscore equity, and advance inclusion. Their unwavering commitment to these\nideals emanates from the following convictions: (i) Diversity encompasses a\nbroad spectrum of differences; (ii) Equity involves the assurance of equitable\nopportunities; and (iii) Inclusion revolves around the cultivation of a sense\nof value and impartiality, concurrently empowering individuals. Data-driven AI\ntools have been used for screening and ranking processes. However, there is a\ngrowing concern that the presence of pre-existing biases in databases may be\nexacerbated, particularly in the context of imbalanced datasets or the\nblack-box-schema. In this research, we propose a model-driven recruitment\ndecision support tool that addresses fairness together with equity in the\nscreening phase. We introduce the term ``pDEI\" to represent the output-input\noriented production efficiency adjusted by socioeconomic disparity. Taking into\naccount various aspects of interpreting socioeconomic disparity, our goals are\n(i) maximizing the relative efficiency of underrepresented groups and (ii)\nunderstanding how socioeconomic disparity affects the cultivation of a\nDEI-positive workplace.",

        "abstract": "The focus on Renewable Energy Communities (REC) is fastly growing after the\nEuropean Union (EU) has introduced a dedicated regulation in 2018. The idea of\ncreating local groups of citizens, small- and medium-sized companies, and\npublic institutions, which self-produce and self-consume energy from renewable\nsources is at the same time a way to save money for the participants, increase\nefficiency of the energy system, and reduce CO$_2$ emissions. Member states\ninside the EU are fixing more detailed regulations, which describe, how public\nincentives are measured. A natural objective for the incentive policies is of\ncourse to promote the self-consumption of a REC. A sophisticated incentive\npolicy is that based on the so called 'virtual framework'. Under this framework\nall the energy produced by a REC is sold to the market, and all the energy\nconsumed must be paid to retailers: self-consumption occurs only 'virtually',\nthanks a money compensation (paid by a central authority) for every MWh\nproduced and consumed by the REC in the same hour. In this context, two\nproblems have to be solved: the optimal investment in new technologies and a\nfair division of the incentive among the community members. We address these\nproblems by considering a particular type of REC, composed by a representative\nhousehold and a biogas producer, where the potential demand of the community is\ngiven by the household's demand, while both members produce renewable energy.\nWe set the problem as a leader-follower problem: the leader decide how to share\nthe incentive for the self-consumed energy, while the followers decide their\nown optimal installation strategy. We solve the leader's problem by searching\nfor a Nash bargaining solution for the incentive's fair division, while the\nfollower problem is solved by finding the Nash equilibria of a static\ncompetitive game between the members.",

In our\nexperiment, participants placed bids for sugar-containing and analogous\nsugar-free products in a Becker-deGroot-Marschak auction to determine the\nwillingness to pay. Additionally, they rated each product on the level of\nperceived healthiness, sweetness, tastiness and familiarity with the product.\nWe then used structural equation modelling to estimate the direct, indirect and\ntotal effect of the label on the willingness to pay. The results suggest that\nsugar-free labels significantly increase the willingness to pay due to the\nperception of sugar-free products as healthier than sugar-containing ones.\nHowever, this positive effect is overridden by a significant decrease in\nperceived sweetness (and hence, tastiness) of products labelled as sugar-free\ncompared to sugar-containing products. As in our sample, healthiness and\ntastiness are positively related, while healthiness and sweetness are related\nnegatively, these results suggest that it is health-sweetness rather than\nhealth-tastiness tradeoff that decreases the efficiency of the sugar-free\nlabelling in nudging consumers towards healthier options.",

Using\nempirical regional knowledge production functions, we establish a significant\ncorrelation between R&D spending and research output, specifically publication\nproductivity, while controlling for patenting activity and socioeconomic\nfactors. Our focus is on the dilemma of research quantity versus quality, which\nis analysed in the context of regional thematic specialization using spatial\nlags. When designing policies and making forecasts, it is important to consider\nthe quality of research measured by established indicators. In this study, we\nexamine the dual effect of research quality on publication activity. We\nidentify two groups of quality factors: those related to the quality of\njournals and those related to the impact of publications. On average, these\nfactors have different influences on quantitative measures. The quality of\njournals shows a negative relationship with quantity, indicating that as\njournal quality increases, the number of publications decreases. On the other\nhand, the impact of publications can be approximated by an inverse parabolic\nshape, with a positive decreasing slope within a common range of values. This\nduality in the relationship between quality factors and quantitative measures\nmay explain some of the significant variations in conclusions found in the\nliterature. We compare several models that explore factors influencing\npublication activity using a balanced panel dataset of Russian regions from\n2009 to 2021. Additionally, we propose a novel approach using thematic\nscientometric parameters as a special type of proximity measure between regions\nin thematic space. Incorporating spatial spillovers in thematic space allows us\nto account for potential cross-sectional dependence in regional data.",

        "abstract": "This paper shows the universal representations of symmetric functions with\nmultidimensional variable-size variables, which help assessing the\njustification of approximation methods aggregating the information of each\nvariable by moments. It then discusses how the results give insights into game\ntheoretic applications, including two-step policy function estimation,\nMoment-based Markov Equilibrium (MME), and aggregative games.\n  Regarding policy function estimations, it is justifiable to estimate a common\npolicy function as a function of own firm's states and the sums of polynomial\nterms (moments) of competitors' states under some conditions, regardless of the\nnumber of firms in each market, as long as the number of moments is\nsufficiently large. Concerning the MME, this study shows that MME is equivalent\nto the Markov Perfect Equilibrium if the number of moments reaches a certain\nlevel and regularity conditions are satisfied. Regarding aggregative games, we\ncan easily show that any games satisfying a condition of symmetry and\ncontinuity of payoff functions can be represented as multidimensional\ngeneralized aggregative, which introduces multidimensional aggregates in the\ngeneralized (fully) aggregative games previous studies have intensively\nstudied.",

Utilizing data from Tokyo's Bunkyo\nmunicipality, this paper provides evidence of considerable manipulation, with\nparents strategically choosing to be waitlisted to enhance the likelihood of\ntheir child's admission into more selective daycare centers. I extend the\nstatic framework of school choice posited by Agarwal and Somaini (2018) to\nincorporate dynamic incentives and estimate a structural model that allows for\nreapplication if waitlisted. Empirical findings indicate that approximately 30%\nof applicants forgo listing safer options in their initial application, a\nbehavior significantly pronounced among those who stand to benefit from the\nwaitlist prioritization. Counterfactual simulations, conducted under the\nscenario of no additional waitlist priority, predict a 17.7% decrease in the\nnumber of waitlisted applicants and a 1.2% increase in overall welfare. These\nfindings highlight the profound influence of dynamic incentives on applicant\nbehavior and underscore the necessity for reevaluating current priority\nmechanisms.",

Technostress,\nemerging from the rapid integration of technology in professional settings, is\nidentified as a significant stressor affecting employees across various\nindustries. The research primarily focuses on the ways in which technostress\ninfluences job performance, both negatively and positively, depending on the\ncontext and individual coping mechanisms. Through a blend of qualitative and\nquantitative methodologies, including surveys and in-depth interviews, the\nstudy examines the experiences of employees from diverse sectors. It highlights\nhow technostress manifests in different forms: from anxiety and frustration due\nto constant connectivity to the pressure of adapting to new technologies. The\npaper also explores the dual role of technology as both a facilitator and a\nhindrance in the workplace.\n  Significant findings indicate that technostress adversely impacts job\nperformance, leading to decreased productivity, diminished job satisfaction,\nand increased turnover intentions. However, the study also uncovers that\nstrategic interventions, such as training programs, supportive leadership, and\nfostering a positive technological culture, can mitigate these negative\neffects. These interventions not only help in managing technostress but also in\nharnessing the potential of technology for enhanced job performance.\n  Furthermore, the research proposes a model outlining the relationship between\ntechnostress, coping mechanisms, and job performance. This model serves as a\nframework for organizations to understand and address the challenges posed by\ntechnostress. The study concludes with recommendations for future research,\nparticularly in exploring the long-term effects of technostress and the\nefficacy of various coping strategies.",

The Domar-Musgrave effect, whereby\ncapital income taxation with full offset provisions encourages risky investment\nthrough loss sharing, explains cases where it is optimal to tax capital income.\nIn further analysis we study the dynamic response to the substitution of\nconsumption taxation for labor income taxation. We find that consumption\nimmediately drops before rising rapidly to the new stationary equilibrium,\nwhich is higher on average than initial consumption for workers but lower for\nentrepreneurs.",

        "abstract": "Do religions codify ecological principles? This paper explores theoretically\nand empirically the role religious beliefs play in shaping environmental\ninteractions. We study African Traditional Religions (ATR) which place forests\nwithin a sacred sphere. We build a model of non-market interactions of the\nmean-field type where the actions of agents with heterogeneous religious\nbeliefs continuously affect the spatial density of forest cover. The\nequilibrium extraction policy shows how individual beliefs and their\ndistribution among the population can be a key driver of forest conservation.\nThe model also characterizes the role of resource scarcity in both individual\nand population extraction decisions. We test the model predictions empirically\nrelying on the unique case of Benin, where ATR adherence is freely reported.\nUsing an instrumental variable strategy that exploits the variation in\nproximity to the Benin-Nigerian border, we find that a 1 standard deviation\nincrease in ATR adherence has a 0.4 standard deviation positive impact on\nforest cover change. We study the impact of historically belonging to the\nancient Kingdom of Dahomey, birthplace of the Vodun religion. Using the\noriginal boundaries as a spatial discontinuity, we find positive evidence of\nDahomey affiliation on contemporary forest change. Lastly, we compare observed\nforest cover to counterfactual outcomes by simulating the absence of ATR\nbeliefs across the population.",

        "abstract": "The ongoing change in Earth`s climate is causing an increase in the frequency\nand severity of climate-related hazards, for example, from coastal flooding,\nriverine flooding, and tropical cyclones. There is currently an urgent need to\nquantify the potential impacts of these events on infrastructure and users,\nespecially for hitherto neglected infrastructure sectors, such as\ntelecommunications, particularly given our increasing dependence on digital\ntechnologies. In this analysis a global assessment is undertaken, quantifying\nthe number of mobile cells vulnerable to climate hazards using open\ncrowdsourced data equating to 7.6 million 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G assets. For a 0.01%\nannual probability event under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), the number\nof affected cells is estimated at 2.26 million for tropical cyclones, equating\nto USD 1.01 billion in direct damage (an increase against the historical\nbaseline of 14% and 44%, respectively). Equally, for coastal flooding the\nnumber of potentially affected cells for an event with a 0.01% annual\nprobability under RCP8.5 is 109.9 thousand, equating to direct damage costs of\nUSD 2.69 billion (an increase against the baseline of 70% and 78%,\nrespectively). The findings demonstrate the need for risk analysts to include\nmobile communications (and telecommunications more broadly) in future critical\nnational infrastructure assessments. Indeed, this paper contributes a proven\nassessment methodology to the literature for use in future research for\nassessing this critical infrastructure sector.",

For example,\nless than 4% of citizens earning more than US $70k annually do not have\nbroadband, compared to 26% of those earning below US $20k annually. To address\nthis, the federal government has undertaken one of the largest broadband\ninvestment programs ever via The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, with the aim of\naddressing this disparity and expanding broadband connectivity to all citizens.\nWe examine broadband availability, adoption, and need for each US state, and\nthen construct an Input-Output model to explore the potential structural\nmacroeconomic impacts of broadband spending on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and\nsupply chain linkages. In terms of macroeconomic impact, the total potential\nindirect contribution to US GDP by the program could be as high as US $84.8\nbillion, $32.7 billion, and $9.78 billion for the Broadband Equity, Access, and\nDeployment program, the Affordable Connectivity Program, and additional\nprograms, respectively. Thus, overall, the broadband allocations could expand\nUS GDP by up to US $127.3 billion (0.10% of annual US GDP over the next five\nyears).

        "abstract": "Interest-free promotions are a prevalent strategy employed by credit card\nlenders to attract new customers, yet the research exploring their effects on\nboth consumers and lenders remains relatively sparse. The process of selecting\nan optimal promotion strategy is intricate, involving the determination of an\ninterest-free period duration and promotion-availability window, all within the\ncontext of competing offers, fluctuating market dynamics, and complex consumer\nbehaviour. In this paper, we introduce an agent-based model that facilitates\nthe exploration of various credit card promotions under diverse market\nscenarios. Our approach, distinct from previous agent-based models,\nconcentrates on optimising promotion strategies and is calibrated using\nbenchmarks from the UK credit card market from 2019 to 2020, with agent\nproperties derived from historical distributions of the UK population from\nroughly the same period. We validate our model against stylised facts and\ntime-series data, thereby demonstrating the value of this technique for\ninvestigating pricing strategies and understanding credit card customer\nbehaviour. Our experiments reveal that, in the absence of competitor\npromotions, lender profit is maximised by an interest-free duration of\napproximately 12 months while market share is maximised by offering the longest\nduration possible. When competitors do not offer promotions, extended promotion\navailability windows yield maximum profit for lenders while also maximising\nmarket share. In the context of concurrent interest-free promotions, we\nidentify that the optimal lender strategy entails offering a more competitive\ninterest-free period and a rapid response to competing promotional offers.\nNotably, a delay of three months in responding to a rival promotion corresponds\nto a 2.4% relative decline in income.",

        "abstract": "Historians and political economists have long debated the processes that led\nland in frontier regions, managed commons, and a variety of customary\nlandholding regimes to be enclosed and transformed into more exclusive forms of\nprivate property. Using the framework of aggregative games, we examine\nland-holding regimes where access to land is established via possession and\nuse, and then explore the factors that may initiate decentralized privatization\nprocesses. Factors including population density, potential for technology\nimprovement, enclosure costs, shifts in group cohesion and bargaining power, or\nthe policy and institutional environment determine the equilibrium mix of\nproperty regimes. While decentralized processes yield efficient enclosure and\ntechnological transformation in some circumstances, in others, the outcomes\nfall short of second-best. This stems from the interaction of different\nspillover effects, leading to inefficiently low rates of enclosure and\ntechnological transformation in some cases and excessive enclosure in others.\nImplementing policies to strengthen customary governance, compensate displaced\nstakeholders, or subsidize/tax enclosure can realign incentives. However,\naddressing one market failure while overlooking others can worsen outcomes. Our\nanalysis offers a unified framework for evaluating claimed mechanisms and\nprocesses across Neoclassical, neo-institutional, and Marxian interpretations\nof enclosure processes.",

Three market structure prototypes are\ndeveloped for different phases. In the infancy, a highly vertically integrated\nstructure is proposed to reduce risks and ensure capital recovery. A\nrestructuring towards a disintegrated structure is necessary in the next stage\nto improve the efficiency. In the late stage, a competitive structure\ncharacterized by a separation between asset ownership and production activities\nand further development of short-term and spot markets is proposed towards a\nmarket-driven industry. Finally, a multi-linear regression model is developed\nto evaluate the developed structures using a case in the gas industry. Results\nindicate that high asset specificity and uncertainty and low frequency lead to\na more disintegrated market structure, and vice versa, thus supporting the\nstructures designed.

History provides examples where greater\nopenness and freer trade emerge from nations seeking only to advance their own\nself-interests. But the cases described in the paper provide mixed signals. We\nfind that some developments do draw on a growing zero-sum perception to\neconomic and political engagement. That zero-sum explanation alone, however, is\ncrucially inadequate. Self-serving nations, even when believing the world\nzero-sum, have under certain circumstances produced outcomes that have\nbenefited all. In other circumstances, perfectly-predicted losses have instead\nresulted on all sides. Such lose-lose outcomes -- epic fail equilibria --\ngeneralize the Prisoner's Dilemma game and are strictly worse than zero-sum. In\nour analysis, Third Nations -- those not frontline in Great Power rivalry --\ncan serve an essential role in averting epic fail outcomes. The policy\nimplication is that Third Nations need to provide platforms that will gently\nand unobtrusively nudge Great Powers away from epic-fail equilibria and towards\ninadvertent cooperation.",

        "abstract": "This article analyzes AI ethics from a distinct business ethics perspective,\ni.e., 'ordoliberalism 2.0.' It argues that the ongoing discourse on\n(generative) AI relies too much on corporate self-regulation and voluntary\ncodes of conduct and thus lacks adequate governance mechanisms. To address\nthese issues, the paper suggests not only introducing hard-law legislation with\na more effective oversight structure but also merging already existing AI\nguidelines with an ordoliberal-inspired regulatory and competition policy.\nHowever, this link between AI ethics, regulation, and antitrust is not yet\nadequately discussed in the academic literature and beyond. The paper thus\ncloses a significant gap in the academic literature and adds to the\npredominantly legal-political and philosophical discourse on AI governance. The\npaper's research questions and goals are twofold: First, it identifies\nordoliberal-inspired AI ethics principles that could serve as the foundation\nfor a 'digital bill of rights.' Second, it shows how those principles could be\nimplemented at the macro level with the help of ordoliberal competition and\nregulatory policy.",

Whether the speed advantage or the\nalgorithmic advantage dominates determines whether a problem will benefit from\nquantum computing or not.

We\nspecified framework user requirements of a template CHEM module that\nfacilitates modular model implementations, a simple programming syntax and\ntools for authoring new CHEM modules, supplying CHEMs with data, reporting\nreproducible CHEM analyses, searching for CHEM modules and maintaining a CHEM\nproject website. We implemented the framework as six development version code\nlibraries in the programming language R that integrate with online services for\nsoftware development and research data archiving. We used the framework to\nauthor five development version R libraries of CHEM modules focused on utility\nmapping in youth mental health. These modules provide tools for variable\nvalidation, dataset description, multi-attribute instrument scoring,\nconstruction of mapping models, reporting of mapping studies and making out of\nsample predictions. We assessed these CHEM module libraries as mostly meeting\ntransparency, reusability and updatability criteria that we have previously\ndeveloped, but requiring more detailed documentation and unit testing of\nindividual modules. Our software framework has potential value as a prototype\nfor future tools to support the development of transferable CHEMs.",

The application presents events as\nexperienced in real life. Both financial and emotional loss-framing events are\nfollowed by choices to purchase insurance. The participant cohorts considered\nwere undergraduate students and older participants; the latter group was\nfurther subdivided by income and education. The within-subject analysis reveals\nthat the loss framing effect on insurance consumption is higher in the younger\npopulation, though contingent on the insurance product type. Health and\naccident insurance shows a negative correlation with risk attitudes for younger\nparticipants and a positive correlation with accident insurance for older\nparticipants. Risk attitude and life insurance products showed no dependency.\nThe findings elucidate the role of age, income, family responsibilities, and\nrisk attitude in purchasing insurance products.

This paper presents financial markets as metastable systems and shows\nthat, under this assumption, financial time series evolve as hidden Markov\nmodels. In special, we propose a theory that outlines an explicit causal\nrelation between a financial market and the evolution of a financial time\nseries. In the context of financial economics and causal factor investment,\nthis theory introduces a paradigm shift, suggesting that investment performance\nfluctuations are primarily driven by the market state rather than direct\ncausation by other variables. While not incompatible with traditional causal\ninference, our approach addresses the non-stationary evolution of time series\nthrough changes in market states, enhancing risk assessment and enabling\nmitigation strategies.",

We collect data for the 200 most popular\nhotels in London (UK) and document that prices vary widely across booking sites\nwhile making reservations for a hotel room. Additionally, we find that prices\nlisted across different platforms tend to converge as the booking date gets\ncloser to the date of stay. However, the price dispersion persists until the\ndate of stay, implying that the \"law of one price\" does not hold. We present a\nsimple theoretical model to explain this and show that in the presence of\naggregate demand uncertainty and capacity constraints, price dispersion could\nexist even when products are homogeneous, consumers are homogeneous, all agents\nhave perfect information about the market structure, and consumers face no\nsearch costs to acquire information about the products. Our theoretical\nintuition and robust empirical evidence provide additional insights into price\ndispersion across online platforms in different institutional settings. Our\nstudy complements the existing literature that relies on consumer search costs\nto explain the price dispersion phenomenon.",

Modern natural language processing methods cannot be\nused to index, retrieve, and summarize their texts; conduct computational\ntextual analyses; or extract information for statistical analyses, and these\ntexts cannot be incorporated into language model training. Given the diversity\nand sheer quantity of public domain texts, liberating them at scale requires\noptical character recognition (OCR) that is accurate, extremely cheap to\ndeploy, and sample-efficient to customize to novel collections, languages, and\ncharacter sets. Existing OCR engines, largely designed for small-scale\ncommercial applications in high resource languages, often fall short of these\nrequirements. EffOCR (EfficientOCR), a novel open-source OCR package, meets\nboth the computational and sample efficiency requirements for liberating texts\nat scale by abandoning the sequence-to-sequence architecture typically used for\nOCR, which takes representations from a learned vision model as inputs to a\nlearned language model. Instead, EffOCR models OCR as a character or word-level\nimage retrieval problem. EffOCR is cheap and sample efficient to train, as the\nmodel only needs to learn characters' visual appearance and not how they are\nused in sequence to form language. Models in the EffOCR model zoo can be\ndeployed off-the-shelf with only a few lines of code. Importantly, EffOCR also\nallows for easy, sample efficient customization with a simple model training\ninterface and minimal labeling requirements due to its sample efficiency. We\nillustrate the utility of EffOCR by cheaply and accurately digitizing 20\nmillion historical U.S. newspaper scans, evaluating zero-shot performance on\nrandomly selected documents from the U.S. National Archives, and accurately\ndigitizing Japanese documents for which all other OCR solutions failed.",

We find that, as a positive factor,\na firm's size is more important than a firm's age by 9.858 times as a merger\nincentive between 1991 and 2005. However, between 2006 and 2022, as a negative\nfactor, a firm's size is more important than a firm's age by 2.013 times, that\nis, a firm's size works as a disincentive. We also find that the distance\nbetween buyer and seller firms works as a disincentive for the whole period,\nbut the importance has dwindled to economic insignificance in recent years. In\ncounterfactual simulations, we observe that the prohibition of mergers between\nfirms in the same country would affect the merger configuration of not only the\nfirms involved in prohibited mergers but also those involved in permitted\nmergers. Finally, we present interview-based evidence of the consistency\nbetween our merger lists, estimations, and counterfactual simulations with the\nindustry experts' historical experiences.",

        "abstract": "Inventory matching is a standard mechanism/auction for trading financial\nstocks by which buyers and sellers can be paired. In the financial world, banks\noften undertake the task of finding such matches between their clients. The\nrelated stocks can be traded without adversely impacting the market price for\neither client. If matches between clients are found, the bank can offer the\ntrade at advantageous rates. If no match is found, the parties have to buy or\nsell the stock in the public market, which introduces additional costs. A\nproblem with the process as it is presently conducted is that the involved\nparties must share their order to buy or sell a particular stock, along with\nthe intended quantity (number of shares), to the bank. Clients worry that if\nthis information were to leak somehow, then other market participants would\nbecome aware of their intentions and thus cause the price to move adversely\nagainst them before their transaction finalizes. We provide a solution, Prime\nMatch, that enables clients to match their orders efficiently with reduced\nmarket impact while maintaining privacy. In the case where there are no\nmatches, no information is revealed. Our main cryptographic innovation is a\ntwo-round secure linear comparison protocol for computing the minimum between\ntwo quantities without preprocessing and with malicious security, which can be\nof independent interest. We report benchmarks of our Prime Match system, which\nruns in production and is adopted by J.P. Morgan. The system is designed\nutilizing a star topology network, which provides clients with a centralized\nnode (the bank) as an alternative to the idealized assumption of point-to-point\nconnections, which would be impractical and undesired for the clients to\nimplement in reality. Prime Match is the first secure multiparty computation\nsolution running live in the traditional financial world.",

        "abstract": "The rising energy prices in Europe and the urgent need to address global\nwarming have sparked a significant increase in the installation of domestic\nphotovoltaic systems to harness solar energy. However, since solar energy is\navailable only during daytime hours and its availability varies daily,\neffectively shifting energy use becomes crucial. Whilst batteries can assist in\nstoring excess energy, their high prices hinder their widespread adoption. In\nthis study, we explore the importance of load to maximise return on investment.\nWe propose an incremental approach to fitting load profiles into the production\nenvelope, allowing for practical implementation. We compare different meter\nresolutions: 1 second, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, and 1 hour. Our analysis reveals\nthat making real-time decisions (per second) leads to significant energy\nsavings of 16\\% compared to hourly decisions. Furthermore, we explore three\ntypes of device management strategies: ON/OFF management independent of PV\nproduction, ON/OFF management based on the current PV production, ON/OFF\nmanagement based on both current and forecasted PV production, utilising an\noptimal fit algorithm. Through our study, we demonstrate that our\nimplementation of the third approach outperforms a standard management\napproach, resulting in more than 17% cost savings. This study provides insights\ninto the optimisation of load-shifting strategies in domestic photovoltaic\ninstallations, highlighting the importance of load control and the potential\nbenefits in maximising the utilisation of solar energy while minimising energy\ncosts and environmental impact.",

        "abstract": "Mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) provides seamless door-to-door trips by\nintegrating different transport modes. Although many MaaS platforms have\nemerged in recent years, most of them remain at a limited integration level.\nThis study investigates the assignment and pricing problem for a MaaS platform\nas an intermediary in a multi-modal transportation network, which purchases\ncapacity from service operators and sells multi-modal trips to travelers. The\nanalysis framework of many-to-many stable matching is adopted to decompose the\njoint design problem and to derive the stability condition such that both\noperators and travelers are willing to participate in the MaaS system. To\nmaximize the flexibility in route choice and remove boundaries between modes,\nwe design an origin-destination pricing scheme for MaaS trips. On the supply\nside, we propose a wholesale purchase price for service capacity. Accordingly,\nthe assignment problem is reformulated and solved as a bi-level program, where\nMaaS travelers make multi-modal trips to minimize their travel costs meanwhile\ninteracting with non-MaaS travelers in the multi-modal transport system. We\nprove that, under the proposed pricing scheme, there always exists a stable\noutcome to the overall many-to-many matching problem. Further, given an optimal\nassignment and under some mild conditions, a unique optimal pricing scheme is\nensured. Numerical experiments conducted on the extended Sioux Falls network\nalso demonstrate that the proposed MaaS system could create a win-win-win\nsituation -- the MaaS platform is profitable and both traveler welfare and\ntransit operator revenues increase from a baseline scenario without MaaS.",

It is optimal to\nbuy life-contingent insurance throughout life, even under loads. A life annuity\nphase backs directly onto a life insurance phase.

Recent\nworks propose data markets to provide monetary incentives for collaborative\nmachine learning, where agents share features with each other and are rewarded\nbased on their contribution to improving the predictions others. These\ncontributions are determined by their relative Shapley value, which is computed\nby treating features as players and their interactions as a characteristic\nfunction game. However, in its standard form, this setup further provides an\nincentive for agents to replicate their data and act under multiple false\nidentities in order to increase their own revenue and diminish that of others,\nrestricting their use in practice. In this work, we develop a\nreplication-robust data market for supervised learning problems. We adopt\nPearl's do-calculus from causal reasoning to refine the characteristic function\ngame by differentiating between observational and interventional conditional\nprobabilities. By doing this, we derive Shapley value-based rewards that are\nrobust to this malicious replication by design, whilst preserving desirable\nmarket properties.",

Supporters argue these\ngrants were neutral and necessary to maintain normal election operations during\nthe pandemic, while critics worry these grants mostly went to Democratic\nstrongholds and tilted election outcomes. These concerns have led twenty-four\nstates to restrict private election grants. How much did these grants shape the\n2020 presidential election? To answer this question, we collect administrative\ndata on private election administration grants and election outcomes. We then\nuse new advances in synthetic control methods to compare presidential election\nresults and turnout in counties that received grants to counties with identical\naverage presidential election results and turnout before 2020. While counties\nthat favor Democrats were much more likely to apply for a grant, we find that\nthe grants did not have a noticeable effect on the presidential election. Our\nestimates of the average effect of receiving a grant on Democratic vote share\nrange from 0.02 percentage points to 0.36 percentage points. Our estimates of\nthe average effect of receiving a grant on turnout range from -0.03 percentage\npoints to 0.13 percentage points. Across specifications, our 95% confidence\nintervals typically include negative effects, and our confidence intervals from\nall specifications fail to include effects on Democratic vote share larger than\n0.58 percentage points and effects on turnout larger than 0.40 percentage\npoints. We characterize the magnitude of our effects by asking how large they\nare compared to the margin by which Biden won the 2020 election. In simple\nbench-marking exercises, we find that the effects of the grants were likely too\nsmall to have changed the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.",

Using Bayesian inference methods, key\nresults suggest (i) a combination of profit-led demand and profit-squeeze\ndistribution; (ii) weakening of these regimes during the Great Moderation; and\n(iii) significant connections between the standard Goodwinian variables and\nresidential investment as well as term spreads.

We decompose\nlabor share movements on those along a share-capital curve, shifts of this\nlocus, and deviations from it. We use the capital-output ratio, total factor\nproductivity and prices of inputs to capture these factors, while the minimum\nwage is introduced as an element that moves the curve off. We estimate a panel\nof 20 manufacturing branches over the 2012-2019 period with FE, IV and\nsystem-GMM estimators. We find that the role of the minimum wage for the labor\nshare is industry-specific. For industrial branches which are labor-intensive\nand low-pay, it increases workers' labor share, along a complementarity between\ncapital and labor. For capital-intensive branches, it reduces labor share,\nlikely through the job loss channel and along a substitutability between labor\nand capital. This applies to both branches where foreign investment and heavy\nindustry are nested.",

In this attempt, the\ncounterfactual scenarios are simulated by using MK-MOD, the Macedonian Tax and\nBenefit Microsimulation Model, incorporating actual data on the shock-s\nmagnitude from the second quarter of 2020. The results suggest that without the\ngovernment interventions, of the country-s two million citizens, an additional\n120,000 people would have been pushed into poverty by COVID-19, where 340,000\nwere already poor before the pandemic. Of the 120,000 newly poor about 16,000\nwould have been pushed into destitute poverty. The government-s automatic\nstabilizers worked to shield the poorest people, though these were clearly\npro-feminine. In all, the analyzed government measures recovered more than half\nof the income loss, which curbed the poverty-increasing effect and pulled an\nadditional 34,000 people out of extreme poverty. The employment-retention\nmeasure was regressive and pro-masculine; the Guaranteed Minimum Income\nrelaxation (including automatic stabilizers) was progressive and pro-feminine;\nand the one-off support has been pro-youth.",

To avoid dealing with a non-convex ordering cone, an equivalent\ncharacterization of the set of Nash equilibria as the intersection of the\nPareto optimal points of $N$ multi-objective problems (i.e.\\ with the natural\nordering cone) is proven. So far, algorithms to compute the exact set of Pareto\noptimal points of a multi-objective problem exist only for the class of linear\nproblems, which reduces the possibility of finding the true set of Nash\nequilibria by those algorithms to linear games only.\n  In this paper, we will consider the larger class of convex games. As,\ntypically, only approximate solutions can be computed for convex vector\noptimization problems, we first show, in total analogy to the result above,\nthat the set of $\\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria can be characterized by\nthe intersection of $\\epsilon$-approximate Pareto optimal points for $N$ convex\nmulti-objective problems. Then, we propose an algorithm based on results from\nvector optimization and convex projections that allows for the computation of a\nset that, on one hand, contains the set of all true Nash equilibria, and is, on\nthe other hand, contained in the set of $\\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria.\nIn addition to the joint convexity of the cost function for each player, this\nalgorithm works provided the players are restricted by either shared polyhedral\nconstraints or independent convex constraints.",

This strategy exploits insights from psychology and consumer marketing.\nMethods: We built an original dataset covering 200 days of vaccination data in\nItaly, including 'open day' events. Open-day events (in short: open days) are\ninstances where COVID-19 vaccines were released in limited quantities and only\nfor a specific day at a specified location (usually, a large pavilion or a\npublic building). Our dependent variables are the number of total and first\ndoses administered in proportion to the eligible population. Our key\nindependent variable is the presence of open-day events in a given region on a\nspecific day. We analyzed the data using regression with fixed effects for time\nand region. The analysis was robust to alternative model specifications.\nFindings: We find that when an open day event was organized, in proportion to\nthe eligible population, there was an average 0.39-0.44 percentage point\nincrease in total doses administered and a 0.30-0.33 percentage point increase\nin first doses administered. These figures correspond to an average increase of\n10,455-11,796 in total doses administered and 8,043-8,847 in the first doses\nadministered. Interpretation: Releasing vaccines in limited quantities and at\nlimited times by organizing open-day events was associated with an increase in\nCOVID-19 vaccinations in most Italian regions.

We identified approaches to designing PB voting that\nminimise cognitive load and enhance the perceived fairness and legitimacy of\nthe digital process from the citizens' perspective. In our study, participants\npreferred voting input formats that are more expressive (like rankings and\ndistributing points) over simpler formats (like approval voting).

We find that, compared to trade in physical goods,\ndigital product exports are more spatially concentrated, have been growing\nfaster, and can offset trade balance estimates, like the United States trade\ndeficit on physical goods.

        "abstract": "This review identifies challenges and effective strategies to decarbonize\nChina's rapidly growing transportation sector, currently the third largest\ncarbon emitter, considering China's commitment to peak carbon emissions by 2030\nand achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Key challenges include rising travel\ndemand, unreached peak car ownership, declining bus ridership, gaps between\nenergy technology research and practical application, and limited institutional\ncapacity for decarbonization. This review categorizes current decarbonization\nmeasures, strategies, and policies in China's transportation sector using the\n\"Avoid, Shift, Improve\" framework, complemented by a novel strategic vector of\n\"Institutional Capacity & Technology Development\" to capture broader\ndevelopment perspectives. This comprehensive analysis aims to facilitate\ninformed decision-making and promote collaborative strategies for China's\ntransition to a sustainable transportation future.",

The primary purpose is to describe the model\ncomponents. The secondary purpose is to demonstrate one component of the model\nby assessing the distributional and welfare impact of recent price changes in\nPakistan. Over the period of November 2020 to November 2022, headline inflation\n41.5 percent, with food and transportation prices increasing most. The analysis\nshows that despite large increases in energy prices, the importance of energy\nprices for the welfare losses due to inflation is limited because energy budget\nshares are small and inflation is relatively low. The overall distributional\nimpact of recent price changes is mildly progressive, but household welfare is\nimpacted significantly irrespective of households position along the income\ndistribution. The biggest driver of welfare losses at the bottom of the income\ndistribution was food price inflation, while inflation in other goods and\nservices was the biggest driver at the top. To compensate households for\nincreased living costs, transfers would need to be on average 40 percent of\npre-inflation expenditure, assuming constant incomes. Behavioural responses to\nprice changes have a negligible impact on the overall welfare cost to\nhouseholds.",

We here mean bias in\nthe technical sense, that the errors that LLMs make in annotating interview\ntranscripts are not random with respect to the characteristics of the interview\nsubjects. Training simpler supervised models on high-quality human annotations\nwith flexible coding leads to less measurement error and bias than LLM\nannotations. Therefore, given that some high quality annotations are necessary\nin order to asses whether an LLM introduces bias, we argue that it is probably\npreferable to train a bespoke model on these annotations than it is to use an\nLLM for annotation.",

        "abstract": "The spread of the coronavirus pandemic had negative repercussions on the\nmajority of transport systems in virtually all countries. After the lockdown\nperiod, travel restriction policies are now frequently adapted almost real-time\naccording to observed trends in the spread of the disease, resulting in a\nrapidly changing transport market situation. Shared micromobility operators,\nwhose revenues entirely come from their customers, need to understand how the\ndemand is affected to adapt their operations. Within this framework, the\npresent paper investigates how different COVID-19 restriction levels have\naffected the usage patterns of shared micromobility.\n  Usage data of two dockless micromobility services (bike and e-scooters)\noperating in Turin (Italy) are analyzed between October 2020 and March 2021, a\nperiod characterized by different travel restriction levels. The average number\nof daily trips, trip distances and trip duration are retrieved for both\nservices, and then compared to identify significant differences in trends as\nrestriction levels change. Additionally, related impacts on the spatial\ndimension of the services are studied through hotspot maps.\n  Results show that both services decreased during restrictions, however\ne-scooters experienced a larger variability in their demand and they had a\nquicker recovery when travel restrictions were loosened. Shared bikes, in\ngeneral, suffered less from travel restriction levels, suggesting their larger\nusage for work and study-related trip purposes, which is confirmed also by the\nanalysis of hotspots. E-scooters are both substituting and complementing public\ntransport according to restriction levels, while usage patterns of shared bikes\nare more independent.",

        "abstract": "Assessing the costs of climate change is essential to finding efficient\npathways for the transition to a net-zero emissions economy, which is necessary\nto stabilise global temperatures at any level. In evaluating the benefits and\ncosts of climate change mitigation, the discount rate converting future damages\nand costs into net-present values influences the timing of mitigation.\n  Here, we amend the DICE model with a stochastic interest rate model to\nconsider the uncertainty of discount rates in the future. Since abatement\nreduces future damages, changing interest rates renders abatement investments\nmore or less beneficial. Stochastic interest rates will hence lead to a\nstochastic abatement strategy.\n  We introduce a simple stochastic abatement model and show that this can\nincrease intergenerational inequality concerning cost and risk.\n  Analysing the sensitivities of the model calibration analytically and\nnumerically exhibits that intergenerational inequality is a consequence of the\nDICE model calibration (and maybe that of IAMs in general).\n  We then show that introducing funding of abatement costs reduces the\nvariation of future cash-flows, which occur at different times but are\noff-setting in their net-present value. This effect can be interpreted as\nimproving intergenerational effort sharing, which might be neglected in\nclassical optimisation. This mechanism is amplified, including dependence of\nthe interest rate risk on the amount of debt to be financed, i.e. considering\nthe limited capacity of funding sources. As an alternative policy optimisation\nmethod, we propose limiting the total cost of damages and abatement below a\nfixed level relative to GDP - this modification induces equality between\ngenerations compared to their respective economic welfare, inducing early and\nfast mitigation of climate change to keep the total cost of climate change\nbelow 3% of global GDP.",

However, there\nis a lack of a general analysis framework to understand how much ES was\nrealized. In this study, we first proposed a Supply-Demand-Flow-Use (SDFU)\nframework that integrates the supply, demand, flow, and use of ES and\ndifferentiates these concepts into different aspects (e.g., potential vs.\nactual ES demand, export and import flows of supply, etc.). Then, we applied\nthe framework to three examples of ES that can be found in typical urban green\nparks (i.e., wild berry supply, pollination, and recreation). We showed how the\nframework could assess the actual use of ES and identify the supply-limited,\ndemand-limited, and supply-demand-balanced types of realized ES. We also\ndiscussed the scaling features, temporal dynamics, and spatial characteristics\nof realized ES, as well as some critical questions for future studies. Although\nfacing challenges, we believe that the applications of the SDFU framework can\nprovide a systematic way to accurately assess the actual use of ES and better\ninform management and policy-making for sustainable use of nature's benefits.\nTherefore, we hope that our study will stimulate more research on realized ES\nand contribute to a deeper understanding of their roles in enhancing human\nwell-being.",

Our work examines whether\nthis increase is achievable given potential constraints in EV mineral supply\nchains. We estimate a model that reflects international sourcing rules,\nheterogeneity in the mineral intensity of predominant battery chemistries, and\nlong-run grid decarbonization efforts. Our efforts yield five key findings.\nFirst, compliance with the proposed standard necessitates replacing at least\n10.21 million new ICEVs with EVs between 2027 and 2032. Second, based on\neconomically viable and geologically available mineral reserves, manufacturing\nsufficient EVs is plausible across most battery chemistries and could, subject\nto the chemistry leveraged, reduce up to 457.3 million total tons of CO2e.\nThird, mineral production capacities of the US and its allies constrain battery\nproduction to a total of 5.09 million EV batteries between 2027 and 2032, well\nshort of deployment requirements to meet EPA standards even if battery\nmanufacturing is optimized to exclusively manufacture materials efficient NMC\n811 batteries. Fourth, disequilibrium between mineral supply and demand results\nin at least 59.54 million tons of CO2e in total lost lifecycle emissions\nbenefits. Fifth, limited present-day production of battery-grade graphite and\nto a lesser extent, cobalt, constrain US electric vehicle battery pack\nmanufacturing under strict sourcing rules. We demonstrate that should mineral\nsupply bottlenecks persist, hybrid electric vehicles may offer equivalent\nlifecycle emissions benefits as EVs while relaxing mineral production demands,\nthough this represents a tradeoff of long-term momentum in electric vehicle\ndeployment in favor of near-term carbon dioxide emissions reductions.",

Did such restrictions further skew grant income towards elite\nscientists and universities? And did increased competition for funding\nundermine participation? UK science funding agencies significantly reduced\nnumbers of grants and total grant funding in response to austerity, but\nsurprisingly restrictions of science funding were relaxed after the 2015\ngeneral election. Exploiting this natural experiment, we show that conventional\nmeasures of university competitiveness are poor proxies for competitiveness. An\nalternative measure of university competitiveness, drawn from complexity\nscience, captures the highly dynamical way in which universities engage in\nscientific subjects. Building on a data set of 43,430 UK funded grants between\n2006 and 2020, we analyse rankings of UK universities and investigate the\neffect of research competitiveness on grant income. When austerity was relaxed\nin 2015 the elasticity of grant income w.r.t. research competitiveness fell,\nreflecting increased effort by researchers at less competitive universities.\nThese scientists increased number and size of grant applications, increasing\ngrant income. The study reveals how funding agencies, facing heterogeneous\ncompetitiveness in the population of scientists, affect research effort across\nthe distribution of competitiveness.",

Here, we identify that existing scientific literature is\ninclined to a narrative-based account of social tipping, lacks a broad\nempirical framework and a multi-systems view. We subsequently outline a dynamic\nsystems approach that entails (i) a systems outlook involving interconnected\nfeedback mechanisms alongside cross-system and cross-scale interactions, and\nincluding a socioeconomic and environmental injustice perspective (ii) directed\ndata collection efforts to provide empirical evidence for and monitor social\ntipping dynamics, (iii) global, integrated, descriptive modelling to project\nfuture dynamics and provide ex-ante evidence for interventions. Research on\nsocial tipping must be accordingly solidified for climate policy relevance.",

        "abstract": "Poland is currently undergoing substantial transformation in its energy\nsector, and gaining public support is pivotal for the success of its energy\npolicies. We conducted a study with 338 Polish participants to investigate\nsocietal attitudes towards various energy sources, including nuclear energy and\nrenewables. Applying a novel network approach, we identified a multitude of\nfactors influencing energy acceptance. Political ideology is the central factor\nin shaping public acceptance, however we also found that environmental\nattitudes, risk perception, safety concerns, and economic variables play\nsubstantial roles. Considering the long-term commitment associated with nuclear\nenergy and its role in Poland's energy transformation, our findings provide a\nfoundation for improving energy policy in Poland. Our research underscores the\nimportance of policies that resonate with the diverse values, beliefs, and\npreferences of the population. While the risk-risk trade-off and\ntechnology-focused strategies are effective to a degree, we advocate for a more\ncomprehensive approach. The framing strategy, which tailors messages to\ndistinct societal values, shows particular promise.",

        "abstract": "Recent academic research has extensively examined algorithmic collusion\nresulting from the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI)-based dynamic\npricing algorithms. Nevertheless, e-commerce platforms employ recommendation\nalgorithms to allocate exposure to various products, and this important aspect\nhas been largely overlooked in previous studies on algorithmic collusion. Our\nstudy bridges this important gap in the literature and examines how\nrecommendation algorithms can determine the competitive or collusive dynamics\nof AI-based pricing algorithms. Specifically, two commonly deployed\nrecommendation algorithms are examined: (i) a recommender system that aims to\nmaximize the sellers' total profit (profit-based recommender system) and (ii) a\nrecommender system that aims to maximize the demand for products sold on the\nplatform (demand-based recommender system). We construct a repeated game\nframework that incorporates both pricing algorithms adopted by sellers and the\nplatform's recommender system. Subsequently, we conduct experiments to observe\nprice dynamics and ascertain the final equilibrium. Experimental results reveal\nthat a profit-based recommender system intensifies algorithmic collusion among\nsellers due to its congruence with sellers' profit-maximizing objectives.\nConversely, a demand-based recommender system fosters price competition among\nsellers and results in a lower price, owing to its misalignment with sellers'\ngoals. Extended analyses suggest the robustness of our findings in various\nmarket scenarios. Overall, we highlight the importance of platforms'\nrecommender systems in delineating the competitive structure of the digital\nmarketplace, providing important insights for market participants and\ncorresponding policymakers.",

To test the\nmethodologies, we utilized a Finnish university as a living lab. Assigning an\noffsetting cost to the footprints significantly altered the financial value of\nthe organization.

Using\nmicro-level data from U.S. Compustat, we find that several indicators of market\npower have steadily increased since 1970. In particular, the aggregate markup\nhas gone up from 10% of price over marginal cost in 1970 to 23% in 2020, and\naggregate returns to scale have risen from 1.00 to 1.13. We connect these\nmarket-power indicators to profitability by showing that the aggregate profit\nshare can be expressed in terms of the aggregate markup, aggregate returns to\nscale, and a sufficient statistic for production networks that captures double\nmarginalization in the economy. We find that despite the rise in market power,\nthe profit share has been constant at 18% of GDP because the increase in\nmonopoly rents has been completely offset by rising fixed costs and changes in\ntechnology. Our empirical results have subtle implications for policymakers:\noverly aggressive enforcement of antitrust law could decrease firm dynamism and\nparadoxically lead to lower competition and higher market power.",

        "abstract": "Based on principal-agent theory and optimal contract theory, companies use\nthe method of increasing executives' shareholding to stimulate collaborative\ninnovation. However, from the aspect of agency costs between management and\nshareholders (i.e. the first type) and between major shareholders and minority\nshareholders (i.e. the second type), the interests of management, shareholders\nand creditors will be unbalanced with the change of the marginal utility of\nexecutive equity incentives.In order to establish the correlation between the\nproportion of shares held by executives and investments in corporate\ninnovation, we have chosen a range of publicly listed companies within China's\nA-share market as the focus of our study. Employing a multi-variable linear\nregression model, we aim to analyze this relationship thoroughly.The following\nmodels were developed: (1) the impact model of executive shareholding on\ncorporate innovation investment; (2) the impact model of executive shareholding\non two types of agency costs; (3)The model is employed to examine the mediating\ninfluence of the two categories of agency costs. Following both correlation and\nregression analyses, the findings confirm a meaningful and positive correlation\nbetween executives' shareholding and the augmentation of corporate innovation\ninvestments. Additionally, the results indicate that executive shareholding\ncontributes to the reduction of the first type of agency cost, thereby\nfostering corporate innovation investment. However, simultaneously, it leads to\nan escalation in the second type of agency cost, thus impeding corporate\ninnovation investment.",

To study this effect, we introduce a Bayesian framework in\nwhich heterogeneous users choose how much information to share with the AI,\nfacing a trade-off between output fidelity and communication cost.

        "abstract": "An increasingly salient public policy challenge is how to manage the growing\nnumber of satellites in orbit, including large constellations. Many policy\ninitiatives have been proposed that attempt to address the problem from\ndifferent angles, but there is a paucity of analytical tools to help\npolicymakers evaluate the efficacy of these different proposals and any\npotential counterproductive outcomes. To help address this problem, this paper\nsummarizes work done to develop an experimental integrated assessment model --\nOrbital Debris Propagators Unified with Economic Systems (OPUS) -- that\ncombines both astrodynamics of the orbital population and economic behavior of\nspace actors. For a given set of parameters, the model first utilizes a given\nastrodynamic propagator to assess the state of objects in orbit. It then uses a\nset of user-defined economic and policy parameters -- e.g. launch prices,\ndisposal regulations -- to model how actors will respond to the economic\nincentives created by a given scenario. For the purposes of testing, the MIT\nOrbital Capacity Tool (MOCAT) version 4S was used as the primary astrodynamics\npropagator to simulate the true expected target collision probability ($p_c$)\nfor a given end-of-life (EOL) disposal plan. To demonstrate\npropagator-agnosticism, a Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density\n(GMPHD) filter was also used to simulate $p_c$. We also explore economic policy\ninstruments to improve both sustainability of and economic welfare from orbit\nuse. In doing so, we demonstrate that this hybrid approach can serve as a\nuseful tool for evaluating policy proposals for managing orbital congestion. We\nalso discuss areas where this work can be made more robust and expanded to\ninclude additional policy considerations.",

Comparing ChatGPT's ratings of Arab, Asian,\nBlack American, Central African, Dutch, Eastern European, Hispanic, Turkish,\nand White American male and female applicants, I show that ethnic and gender\nidentity influence the chatbot's evaluations. Ethnic discrimination is more\npronounced than gender discrimination and mainly occurs in jobs with favourable\nlabour conditions or requiring greater language proficiency.

Some investors who delegate\nchoose a low quality expert with high earnings, suggesting a role for chasing\npast performance. We find no evidence for a fourth possible motive, that\ndelegation makes risk more acceptable.",

        "abstract": "Transportation systems will be likely transformed by the emergence of\nautomated vehicles (AVs) promising for safe, convenient, and efficient\nmobility, especially if used in shared systems (shared AV or SAV). However, the\npotential tendency is observed towards owning AV as a private asset rather than\nusing SAV. This calls for a research on investigating individuals' attitude\ntowards AV in comparison with SAV to recognize the barriers to the public's\ntendency towards SAV. To do so, the present study proposes a modeling framework\nbased on the theories in behavioral psychology to explain individuals'\npreference for owning AV over using SAV, built as a latent (subjective)\npsychometric construct, by three groups of explanatory latent constructs\nincluding: (i) desire for searching for benefits, i.e., extrinsic motive\nmanifested in utilitarian beliefs; (ii) tendency towards seeking pleasure and\njoy, i.e., intrinsic motive reflected in hedonic beliefs; and (iii) attitude\ntowards three configurations of shared mobility, i.e., experience with car and\nridesharing, bikesharing, and public transit. Estimated on a sample dataset\nfrom the State of California, the findings can shed initial lights on the\npsychological determinants of the public's attitude towards owning AV versus\nusing SAV, which can furthermore provide policy implications intriguing for\npolicy makers and stakeholders. Of note, the findings reveal the strongest\ninfluential factor on preference for AV over SAV as hedonic beliefs reflected\nin perceived enjoyment. This preference is next affected by utilitarian\nbeliefs, particularly perceived benefit and trust of stranger, followed by\nattitude towards car and ride sharing.",

        "abstract": "This paper offers an independent assessment of certain key economic effects\nof the Iberian Exception (IE). Their stated aim was to reduce the major\ncomponent of electricity prices for most Iberian consumers, a component which\nwas indexed to Iberian wholesale power market spot prices power market prices\nthat were rising alarmingly due to extremely tight international markets for\nnatural gas. The Spanish Government estimates that, during its first 100 days,\nthe IE provided substantial benefits for consumers affected by the IE, which\nincluded over 10 million small consumers as well as many large ones, but the\nauthors of this study question that estimate. The authors of this paper argue\nthat the estimated effect of the IE on retail prices depends critically on the\nassumptions about what would have occurred in the absence of the IE, i.e., in a\ncounterfactual scenario. Although counterfactuals are always difficult to\nconstruct, the government s counterfactual ignores demand elasticity, and this\ninflates their estimate of immediate consumer benefits. Using hourly data on\nthe wholesale electricity market for the first 100 days of the IE, this paper s\nanalysis of alternative counterfactuals that reflect the effects of demand\nelasticity shows substantially lower benefits of the IE for consumers than the\nSpanish government estimates. Indeed, this paper s analysis suggests that\naffected consumers would have paid somewhat less for electricity in the first\n100 days of the IE had it not been introduced. The authors identify several\nother potential short and longterm effects of the IE that deserve further\nstudy. These include increased margins for fossil fired generators, reduced\nmargins for some decarbonized inframarginal plant, heightened investor\nperceptions of regulatory risk, weakened incentives for efficient consumption,\nand higher carbon emissions and gas prices.",

We examine the effects of the two\nincidents on U.S. imports separately and collectively, with various economic\nscopes. Our findings uncover intricate trading dynamics among the U.S., China,\nand Southeast Asia, through which businesses relocated portions of their global\nsupply chain away from China to avoid high tariffs. Our analysis indicates that\nincreased tariffs cause the U.S. to import less from China. Meanwhile,\nSoutheast Asian exporters have integrated more into value chains centered on\nChinese suppliers by participating more in assembling and completing products.\nHowever, the worldwide lockdowns over pandemic have reversed this trend as,\nover this period, the U.S. effectively imported more goods directly from China\nand indirectly through Southeast Asian exporters that imported from China.",

Decision support systems, from business intelligence software to\npublic search engines, present individuals with decision aids -- discrete\npresentations of relevant information, interpretative frames, or heuristics --\nto enhance the quality and speed of decision making, but have the potential to\nbias judgments through the selective presentation of information and\ninterpretative frames. We redescribe the wisdom of the crowd as often having\ntwo decisions, the choice of decision aids and then the primary decision. We\nthen define \\emph{metawisdom of the crowd} as any pattern by which the\ncollective choice of aids leads to higher crowd accuracy than randomized\nassignment to the same aids, a comparison that accounts for the information\ncontent of the aids. While choice is ultimately constrained by the setting, in\ntwo experiments -- the prediction of inflation (N=947, pre-registered) and a\ntightly controlled estimation game (N=1198) -- we find strong evidence of\nmetawisdom. It comes about through diverse errors arising through the use of\ndiverse aids, not through widespread use of the aids that induce the most\naccurate estimates. Thus the microfoundations of crowd wisdom appear in the\nfirst choice, suggesting crowd wisdom can be robust in information choice\nproblems.

To this end, we run a large-scale choice experiment to\nelicit consumers' valuation for their Facebook data while randomizing two\ncommon choice frames: default and price anchor. An opt-out default decreases\nvaluations by 14-22% compared to opt-in, while a \\$0-50 price anchor decreases\nvaluations by 37-53% compared to a \\$50-100 anchor.

A bias-exacerbating effect emerges when consumers'\nprivacy valuations and frame effects are negatively correlated. On the other\nhand, a volume-maximizing frame may also mitigate the bias by getting a high\npercentage of consumers into the sample data, thereby improving its coverage.\nWe demonstrate the magnitude of the volume-bias trade-off in our data and argue\nthat it should be a decision-making factor in choice architecture design.",

That limits the accuracy of the forecasts of\nprice and return probabilities by Gaussian distributions. The economic origin\nof these restrictions lies in the fact that the predictions of the market-based\nn-th statistical moments of price and return for n=1,2,.., require the\ndescription of the economic variables of the n-th order that are determined by\nsums of the n-th degrees of values or volumes of market trades. The lack of\nexisting models that describe the evolution of the economic variables\ndetermined by the sums of the 2nd degrees of market trades results in the fact\nthat even predictions of the volatilities of price and return are very\nuncertain. One can ignore existing economic barriers that we highlight but\ncannot overcome or resolve them. The accuracy of predictions of price and\nreturn probabilities substantially determines the reliability of asset pricing\nmodels and portfolio theories.

We analyze the U.S.\ninfant formula market, where over half of the total sales are purchased by the\nWomen, Infants, and Children (WIC) program. The WIC program utilizes\nfirst-price auctions to solicit rebates from the three main formula\nmanufacturers, with the winner exclusively serving all WIC consumers in the\nwinning state. The manufacturers compete aggressively in providing rebates\nwhich account for around 85% of the wholesale price. To rationalize and\ndisentangle the factors contributing to this phenomenon, we model\nmanufacturers' retail pricing competition by incorporating two unique features:\nprice inelastic WIC consumers and government regulation on WIC brand prices.\nOur findings confirm three sizable benefits from winning the auction: a notable\nspill-over effect on non-WIC demand, a significant marginal cost reduction, and\na higher retail price for the WIC brand due to the price inelasticity of WIC\nconsumers. Our counterfactual analysis shows that procurement auctions affect\nmanufacturers asymmetrically, with the smallest manufacturer harmed the most.\nMore importantly, by switching from the current mechanism to a predetermined\nrebate procurement, the government can still contain the cost successfully,\nconsumers' surplus is greatly improved, and the smallest manufacturer benefits\nfrom the switch, promoting market competition.",

        "abstract": "Crop yields and harvest prices are often considered to be negatively\ncorrelated, thus acting as a natural risk management hedge through stabilizing\nrevenues. Storage theory gives reason to believe that the correlation is an\nincreasing function of stocks carried over from previous years.\nStock-conditioned second moments have implications for price movements during\nshortages and for hedging needs, while spatially varying yield-price\ncorrelation structures have implications for who benefits from commodity\nsupport policies. In this paper, we propose to use semi-parametric quantile\nregression (SQR) with penalized B-splines to estimate a stock-conditioned joint\ndistribution of yield and price. The proposed method, validated through a\ncomprehensive simulation study, enables sampling from the true joint\ndistribution using SQR. Then it is applied to approximate stock-conditioned\ncorrelation and revenue insurance premium for both corn and soybeans in the\nUnited States. For both crops, Cornbelt core regions have more negative\ncorrelations than do peripheral regions. We find strong evidence that\ncorrelation becomes less negative as stocks increase. We also show that\nconditioning on stocks is important when calculating actuarially fair revenue\ninsurance premiums. In particular, revenue insurance premiums in the Cornbelt\ncore will be biased upward if the model for calculating premiums does not allow\ncorrelation to vary with stocks available. The stock-dependent correlation can\nbe viewed as a form of tail dependence that, if unacknowledged, leads to\nmispricing of revenue insurance products.",

Such issues can be modeled as problems\nof complex systems, traditionally approached through experiments involving\nhuman subjects or agent-based modeling methods. We propose an innovative\nframework called Smart Agent-Based Modeling (SABM), wherein smart agents,\nsupported by GPT-4 technologies, represent firms, and interact with one\nanother. We conducted a controlled experiment to study firm price competition\nand collusion behaviors under various conditions. SABM is more cost-effective\nand flexible compared to conducting experiments with human subjects. Smart\nagents possess an extensive knowledge base for decision-making and exhibit\nhuman-like strategic abilities, surpassing traditional ABM agents. Furthermore,\nsmart agents can simulate human conversation and be personalized, making them\nideal for studying complex situations involving communication. Our results\ndemonstrate that, in the absence of communication, smart agents consistently\nreach tacit collusion, leading to prices converging at levels higher than the\nBertrand equilibrium price but lower than monopoly or cartel prices. When\ncommunication is allowed, smart agents achieve a higher-level collusion with\nprices close to cartel prices. Collusion forms more quickly with communication,\nwhile price convergence is smoother without it. These results indicate that\ncommunication enhances trust between firms, encouraging frequent small price\ndeviations to explore opportunities for a higher-level win-win situation and\nreducing the likelihood of triggering a price war. We also assigned different\npersonas to firms to analyze behavioral differences and tested variant models\nunder diverse market structures. The findings showcase the effectiveness and\nrobustness of SABM and provide intriguing insights into competition and\ncollusion.",

However, EV market share is still low and is forecast to\nremain low and uncertain. This shows a research need for an in-depth\nunderstanding of EV adoption behavior with a focus on one of the main barriers\nto the mass EV adoption, which is the limited electric driving range. The\npresent study extends the existing literature in two directions; First, the\ninfluence of the psychological aspect of driving range, which is referred to as\nrange anxiety, is explored on EV adoption behavior by presenting a nested logit\n(NL) model with a latent construct. Second, the two-level NL model captures\nindividuals' decision on EV adoption behavior distinguished by vehicle\ntransaction type and EV type, where the upper level yields the vehicle\ntransaction type selected from the set of alternatives including\nno-transaction, sell, trade, and add. The fuel type of the vehicles decided to\nbe acquired, either as traded-for or added vehicles, is simultaneously\ndetermined at the lower level from a set including conventional vehicle, hybrid\nEV, PHEV, and BEV. The model is empirically estimated using a stated\npreferences dataset collected in the State of California. A notable finding is\nthat anxiety about driving range influences the preference for BEV, especially\nas an added than traded-for vehicle, but not the decision on PHEV adoption.",

Our\nstudy analyses the relationship between two primary benefits: the\nhousehold-level financial gain and the broader environmental advantage.\nFocusing on the intention to adopt Rooftop Photovoltaic Systems, Energy\nEfficient Appliances, and Green Electricity Tariffs, we employ Partial Least\nSquares Structural Equation Modeling to demonstrate that the adoption intention\nof the LCTs is underpinned by the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Attitudes toward\nthe LCTs are more strongly related to product-specific benefits than affective\nconstructs. In terms of evaluative benefits, environmental benefits exhibit a\nhigher positive association with attitude formation compared to financial\nbenefits. However, this relationship switches as homeowners move through the\ndecision process with the financial benefits of selected LCTs having a\nconsistently higher association with adoption intention. At the same time,\nfinancial benefits also positively affect attitudes. Observing this trend\nacross both low- and high-cost LCTs, we recommend that policymakers amplify\nhomeowners' recognition of the individual benefits intrinsic to LCTs and enact\nmeasures that ensure these financial benefits.",

Empirical results\nindicate that this 'happiness' search exposure (HSE) can explain future\nreturns, particularly for big and value firms. This suggests that HSE might be\na reflection of a firm's ability to produce goods or services that meet\nsocietal utility needs. Our findings have significant implications for\ninstitutional investors seeking to leverage HSE-based strategies for\noutperformance. Additionally, our research suggests that, when selected\njudiciously, some search topics on Google Trends can be related to risks that\nimpact stock prices.",

The intriguing question is, what distribution\nfunction does the trade strength fulfill? In this paper, a theoretical\nfoundation for predicting the distribution of trade strength and the rate of\nchange of trade strength were developed. These two quantities were found to\nsatisfy the Pareto distribution function. The equations were confirmed using\ndata from the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) and the World Bank by\ncomparing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information\nCriterion (BIC) to five types of distribution functions (exponential,\nlognormal, gamma, Pareto, and Weibull).

In a model that features temporary benefits and sequential job\nopportunities, a worker's reservation wages are studied when policymakers can\nmake discretionary extensions to benefits. A worker's optimal labor-supply\nchoice is characterized by a sequence of reservation wages that increases with\nweeks of remaining benefits. The possibility of an extension raises the entire\nsequence of reservation wages, meaning a worker is more selective when\naccepting job offers throughout their spell of unemployment. The welfare\nconsequences of misperceiving the probability and length of an extension are\ninvestigated. Properties of the model can help policymakers interpret data on\nreservation wages, which may be important if extended benefits are used more\noften in response to economic slumps, virus pandemics, extreme heat, and\nnatural disasters.",

This paper presents a\ndata-driven guide to the forum that started the hype -- WallStreetBets (WSB).\nOur initial experiments decompose the forum using a large language topic model\nand network tools. The topic model describes the evolution of the forum over\ntime and shows the persistence of certain topics (such as the market / S\\&P500\ndiscussion), and the sporadic interest in others, such as COVID or crude oil.\nNetwork analysis allows us to decompose the landscape of retail investors into\nclusters based on their posting and discussion habits; several large,\ncorrelated asset discussion clusters emerge, surrounded by smaller, niche ones.\nA second set of experiments assesses the impact that WSB discussions have had\non the market. We show that forum activity has a Granger-causal relationship\nwith the returns of several assets, some of which are now commonly classified\nas `meme stocks', while others have gone under the radar. The paper extracts a\nset of short-term trade signals from posts and long-term (monthly and weekly)\ntrade signals from forum dynamics, and considers their predictive power at\ndifferent time horizons.

Coal coupled with carbon\ncapture and storage is also used in the steel sector as an intermediary step\nwhen Russian gas is neglected, before being fully decarbonized with hydrogen.\nHydrogen production mostly relies on natural gas with carbon capture and\nstorage until natural gas is scarce and costly at which time green hydrogen\nproduction increases sharply.

        "title": "Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown Measures on Chinese Startups and Local Government Public Finance: Challenges and Policy Implications",
        "abstract": "This paper aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the public finance of\nChinese local governments, with a particular focus on the effect of lockdown\nmeasures on startups during the pandemic. The outbreak has placed significant\nfiscal pressure on local governments, as containment measures have led to\ndeclines in revenue and increased expenses related to public health and social\nwelfare. In tandem, startups have faced substantial challenges, including\nreduced funding and profitability, due to the negative impact of lockdown\nmeasures on entrepreneurship. Moreover, the pandemic has generated short- and\nlong-term economic shocks, affecting both employment and economic recovery. To\naddress these challenges, policymakers must balance health concerns with\neconomic development. In this regard, the government should consider\nimplementing more preferential policies that focus on startups to ensure their\nsurvival and growth. Such policies may include financial assistance, tax\nincentives, and regulatory flexibility to foster innovation and\nentrepreneurship. By and large, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact\non both the public finance of Chinese local governments and the startup\necosystem. Addressing the challenges faced by local governments and startups\nwill require a comprehensive approach that balances health and economic\nconsiderations and includes targeted policies to support entrepreneurship and\ninnovation.",

In particular, the EC toolbox has proved particularly\npromising in the study of complex and interrelated phenomena, such as the\ntransition towards a greener economy. Using the EC approach, scholars have been\ninvestigating the relationship between EC and sustainability, proposing to\nidentify the distinguishing characteristics of green products and to assess the\nreadiness of productive and technological structures for the sustainability\ntransition. This article proposes to review and summarize the data, methods,\nand empirical literature that are relevant to the study of the sustainability\ntransition from an EC perspective. We review three distinct but connected\nblocks of literature on EC and environmental sustainability. First, we survey\nthe evidence linking measures of EC to indicators related to environmental\nsustainability. Second, we review articles that strive to assess the green\ncompetitiveness of productive systems. Third, we examine evidence on green\ntechnological development and its connection to non-green knowledge bases.\nFinally, we summarize the findings for each block and identify avenues for\nfurther research in this recent and growing body of empirical literature.",

Linear regression with a logarithmic linear equation\nencounters an indefinite value on the logarithmic trade. Although several\napproaches to solving this problem have been proposed, the majority of them are\nno longer based on linear regression, making the process of finding solutions\nmore complex. In this work, we suggest a two-step technique for determining the\ngravity parameters: first, perform linear regression locally to establish a\ndummy value to substitute trade flow zero, and then estimating the gravity\nparameters. Iterative techniques are used to determine the optimum parameters.\nMachine learning is used to test the estimated parameters by analyzing their\nposition in the cluster. We calculated international trade figures for 2004,\n2009, 2014, and 2019. We just examine the classic gravity equation and discover\nthat the powers of GDP and distance are in the same cluster and are both worth\nroughly one.

Actual wind damage\ndata from the Canadian insurance market were considered in this study. Our\ncalculations show that ON and QC received half of all wind catastrophes across\nCanada, and nearly three-quarters of all types of catastrophes in ON and QC\nwere wind-related ones. The total windstorm loss of over CA$5.2 billion was not\nevenly distributed between QC and ON, but rather had a QC:ON ratio of 1:3.1. We\nattributed this discrepancy in the inflicted damage between two provinces to\nthe predominantly eastward and northeastward storm trajectories and the higher\ndensity of wealth and population in ON. Convective storms were the most\ndevastating wind type comprising nearly 65% and 67% of the total number of\nevents and associated damage, respectively.

        "abstract": "This is the English version of my inaugural lecture at Coll\\`ege de France in\n2021, available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxktplKMhKU. I reflect on\nthe difficulty of multi-disciplinary research, which often hinges of unexpected\nepistemological and methodological differences, for example about the\nscientific status of models. What is the purpose of a model? What are we\nultimately trying to establish: rigorous theorems or ad-hoc calculation\nrecipes; absolute truth, or heuristic representations of the world? I argue\nthat the main contribution of statistical physics to social and economic\nsciences is to make us realise that unexpected behaviour can emerge at the\naggregate level, that isolated individuals would never experience. Crises,\npanics, opinion reversals, the spread of rumours or beliefs, fashion effects\nand the zeitgeist, but also the existence of money, lasting institutions,\nsocial norms and stable societies, must be understood in terms of collective\nbelief and/or trust, self-sustained by interactions, or on the contrary, the\nrapid collapse of this belief or trust. The Appendix contains my opening\nremarks to the workshop ``More is Different'', as a tribute to Phil Anderson.",

Here, we assess which models of AI exposure predict job\nseparations and unemployment risk using new occupation-level unemployment data\nby occupation from each US state's unemployment insurance office spanning 2010\nthrough 2020. Although these AI exposure scores have been used by governments\nand industry, we find that individual AI exposure models are not predictive of\nunemployment rates, unemployment risk, or job separation rates. However, an\nensemble of those models exhibits substantial predictive power suggesting that\ncompeting models may capture different aspects of AI exposure that collectively\naccount for AI's variable impact across occupations, regions, and time.

Human\nresponsibility for outcomes becomes unclear in the interaction with these\nsystems, as parts of information acquisition, decision-making, and action\nimplementation may be carried out jointly by humans and systems. Determining\nhuman causal responsibility with intelligent systems is particularly important\nin events that end with adverse outcomes. We developed three measures of\nretrospective human causal responsibility when using intelligent systems. The\nfirst measure concerns repetitive human interactions with a system. Using\ninformation theory, it quantifies the average human's unique contribution to\nthe outcomes of past events. The second and third measures concern human causal\nresponsibility in a single past interaction with an intelligent system. They\nquantify, respectively, the unique human contribution in forming the\ninformation used for decision-making and the reasonability of the actions that\nthe human carried out. The results show that human retrospective responsibility\ndepends on the combined effects of system design and its reliability, the\nhuman's role and authority, and probabilistic factors related to the system and\nthe environment. The new responsibility measures can serve to investigate and\nanalyze past events involving intelligent systems. They may aid the judgment of\nhuman responsibility and ethical and legal discussions, providing a novel\nquantitative perspective.",

This paper considers a shipping company with limited\ncapacity which will ship a group of products with heterogeneous transportation\nand production costs and prices, and investigates the minimum quota regulation\non transportation amounts stipulated by the government. An interesting example\ncan happen in North American rail transportation market, where the rail\ncapacity is used for a variety of products and commodities such as oil and\ngrains. Similarly, in Europe supply chain of grains produced in Ukraine is\ndisrupted by the Ukraine war and the blockade of sea transportation routes,\nwhich puts pressure on rail transportation capacity of Ukraine and its\nneighboring countries to the west that needs to be shared for shipping a\nvariety of products including grains, military, and humanitarian supplies. Such\nsituations require a proper execution of government intervention for effective\nmanagement of the limited transportation capacity to avoid the rippling effects\nthroughout the economy. We propose mathematical models and solutions for the\nmarket players and the government in a Canadian case study. Subsequently, the\nconditions that justify government intervention are identified, and an\nalgorithm to obtain the optimum minimum quotas is presented.",

However,\nthe store-of-value characteristic of these digital assets remains largely\nuncharted. Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin, once likened Bitcoin to gold\nand Litecoin to silver.

Furthermore, we've devised trading strategies\ncentered around the Price-to-Utility (PU) ratio, offering a fresh perspective\non crypto-asset valuation beyond traditional utilities. Our back-testing\nresults not only display trading indicators for both Bitcoin and Litecoin but\nalso substantiate Lee's metaphor, underscoring Bitcoin's superior\nstore-of-value proposition relative to Litecoin.

        "abstract": "Human interactions create social networks forming the backbone of societies.\nIndividuals adjust their opinions by exchanging information through social\ninteractions. Two recurrent questions are whether social structures promote\nopinion polarisation or consensus in societies and whether polarisation can be\navoided, particularly on social media. In this paper, we hypothesise that not\nonly network structure but also the timings of social interactions regulate the\nemergence of opinion clusters. We devise a temporal version of the Deffuant\nopinion model where pairwise interactions follow temporal patterns and show\nthat burstiness alone is sufficient to refrain from consensus and polarisation\nby promoting the reinforcement of local opinions. Individuals self-organise\ninto a multi-partisan society due to network clustering, but the diversity of\nopinion clusters further increases with burstiness, particularly when\nindividuals have low tolerance and prefer to adjust to similar peers. The\nemergent opinion landscape is well-balanced regarding clusters' size, with a\nsmall fraction of individuals converging to extreme opinions. We thus argue\nthat polarisation is more likely to emerge in social media than offline social\nnetworks because of the relatively low social clustering observed online.\nCounter-intuitively, strengthening online social networks by increasing social\nredundancy may be a venue to reduce polarisation and promote opinion diversity.",

This\nanalysis allows us to know whether people choose mates in a positive or a\nnegative assortative manner regarding only-child status, and to predict whether\nonly-child individuals benefit from marriage matching premiums or are subject\nto penalties regarding partner attractiveness. Second, we measure the\npremium/penalty by the size of the gap in partner's socio economic status (SES,\nhere, years of schooling) between only-child and non--only-child individuals.\nThe conventional economic theory and the observed marriage patterns of positive\nassortative mating on only-child status predict that only-child individuals are\nsubject to a matching penalty in the marriage market, especially when their\npartner is also an only child. Furthermore, our estimation confirms that among\nespecially women marrying an only-child husband, only children are penalized in\nterms of 0.57-years-lower educational attainment on the part of the partner.",

We provide a simple and new\napproach that is rooted in linear algebra and basic graph theory to capture the\ndynamics of income circulation among economic agents. A new linear algebraic\nmodel for income circulation is introduced, based on which we are able to\ncategorize societies as fragmented or cohesive. We show that, in the case of\nfragmented societies, convincing wealthy agents at the top of the social\nhierarchy to support the poor and vulnerable will be very difficult. We also\nhighlight how linear-algebraic and simple graph-theoretic methods help explain,\nfrom a fundamental point of view, some of the mechanics of class struggle in\nfragmented societies. Then, we explain intuitively and prove mathematically\nwhy, in cohesive societies, wealthy agents at the top of the social hierarchy\ntend to benefit by supporting the vulnerable in their society. A number of new\nconcepts emerge naturally from our mathematical analysis to describe the level\nof cohesiveness of the society, the number of degrees of separation in business\n(as opposed to social) networks, and the level of generosity of the overall\neconomy, which all tend to affect the rate at which the top wealthy class\nrecovers its support money back.

In India, women are often\ndiscriminated against and are not provided with equal rights and opportunities,\nleading to a gender bias in many aspects of life. This gender bias is further\nexacerbated by the misuse of law by women. There are numerous instances of\nwomen using the law to their advantage, often at the expense of men. This\npractice is not only unethical but also unconstitutional. The Indian\nConstitution does not explicitly guarantee gender equality. However, several\namendments have been made to the Constitution to ensure that women are treated\nequally in accordance with the law. The protection of women from all forms of\ndiscrimination is considered a fundamental right. Despite this, women continue\nto be discriminated against in various spheres of life, including marriage,\neducation, employment and other areas. The misuse of law by women in India is\nprimarily seen in cases of domestic violence and dowry-related issues and are\npunishable by law. However, women often file false dowry harassment cases\nagainst their husbands or in-laws in order to gain an advantage in a divorce or\nproperty dispute.",

In turn, the long tails\nare reflected in the goods and services that fulfill those needs. With this\nbackground, we propose a theoretical model of economic activity on a long tail\ndistribution, where innovation in demand for new niche outputs competes with\ninnovation in supply automation for mature outputs. Our model yields analytic\nexpressions and asymptotes for the shares of automation and labor in terms of\njust four parameters: the rates of innovation in supply and demand, the\nexponent of the long tail distribution and an initial value.

This study aims to investigate the impact of TNCs on the labor\nsupply of the taxi industry, estimate wage elasticity, and understand the\nchanges in taxi drivers' work preferences. We introduce the wage decomposition\nmethod to quantify the effects of TNC trips on taxi drivers' work hours over\ntime, based on taxi and TNC trip record data from 2013 to 2018 in New York\nCity. The data are analyzed to evaluate the changes in overall market\nperformances and taxi drivers' work behavior through statistical analyses, and\nour results show that the increase in TNC trips not only decreases the income\nlevel of taxi drivers but also discourages their willingness to work. We find\nthat 1% increase in TNC trips leads to 0.28% reduction in the monthly revenue\nof the yellow taxi industry and 0.68% decrease in the monthly revenue of the\ngreen taxi industry in recent years. More importantly, we report that the work\nbehavior of taxi drivers shifts from the widely accepted neoclassical standard\nbehavior to the reference-dependent preference (RDP) behavior, which signifies\na persistent trend of loss in labor supply for the taxi market and hints at the\ncollapse of taxi industry if the growth of TNCs continues.

        "abstract": "We study how the climate transition through a low-carbon economy, implemented\nby carbon pricing, propagates in a credit portfolio and precisely describe how\ncarbon price dynamics affects credit risk measures such as probability of\ndefault, expected and unexpected losses. We adapt a stochastic multisectoral\nmodel to take into account the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions costs of both\nsectoral firms' production and consumption, as well as sectoral household's\nconsumption. GHG emissions costs are the product of carbon prices, provided by\nthe NGFS transition scenarios, and of GHG emissions. For each sector, our model\nyields the sensitivity of firms' production and households' consumption to\ncarbon price and the relationships between sectors. It allows us to analyze the\nshort-term effects of the carbon price as opposed to standard IAM (such as\nREMIND), which are deterministic and only capture long-term trends. Finally, we\nuse a DCF methodology to compute firms' values which we then combine with a\nstructural credit risk model to describe how the carbon price impacts credit\nrisk measures. We obtain that the carbon price distorts the distribution of the\nfirm's value, increases banking fees charged to clients (materialized by the\nbank provisions), and reduces banks' profitability (translated by the economic\ncapital). In addition, the randomness we introduce provides extra flexibility\nto take into account uncertainties on the productivity and on the different\ntransition scenarios. We also compute the sensitivities of the credit risk\nmeasures with respect to changes in the carbon price, yielding further criteria\nfor a more accurate assessment of climate transition risk in a credit\nportfolio. This work provides a preliminary methodology to calculate the\nevolution of credit risk measures of a credit portfolio, starting from a given\nclimate transition scenario described by a carbon price.",

        "abstract": "Water markets represent a policy tool that aims at finding efficient water\nallocations among competing users by promoting reallocations from low-value to\nhigh-value uses. In Canada, water markets have been discussed and implemented\nat the provincial level; however, at the national level a study about the\neconomic benefits of its implementation is still lacking. This paper fills this\nvoid by implementing a water market in Canada and examine how water endowment\nshocks would affect the economy under the assumptions of general equilibrium\ntheory. Our results show a water market would damp the economic loss in case of\nreductions in water endowment, but it also cuts back on the economic expansion\nthat would follow from an increase on it. These results provide new insights on\nthe subject and will provide a novel look and reinvigorate informed discussions\non the use of water markets in Canada as a potential tool to cope with\nclimate-induced water supply changes.",

        "abstract": "Contemporary real-world online ad auctions differ from canonical models\n[Edelman et al., 2007; Varian, 2009] in at least four ways: (1) values and\nclick-through rates can depend upon users' search queries, but advertisers can\nonly partially \"tune\" their bids to specific queries; (2) advertisers do not\nknow the number, identity, and precise value distribution of competing bidders;\n(3) advertisers only receive partial, aggregated feedback, and (4) payment\nrules are only partially known to bidders. These features make it virtually\nimpossible to fully characterize equilibrium bidding behavior. This paper shows\nthat, nevertheless, one can still gain useful insight into modern ad auctions\nby modeling advertisers as agents governed by an adversarial bandit algorithm,\nindependent of auction mechanism intricacies. To demonstrate our approach, we\nfirst simulate \"soft-floor\" auctions [Zeithammer, 2019], a complex, real-world\npricing rule for which no complete equilibrium characterization is known. We\nfind that (i) when values and click-through rates are query-dependent, soft\nfloors can improve revenues relative to standard auction formats even if bidder\ntypes are drawn from the same distribution; and (ii) with distributional\nasymmetries that reflect relevant real-world scenario, we find that soft floors\nyield lower revenues than suitably chosen reserve prices, even restricting\nattention to a single query. We then demonstrate how to infer advertiser value\ndistributions from observed bids for a variety of pricing rules, and illustrate\nour approach with aggregate data from an e-commerce website.",

We investigate the ability of three of the most advanced\nchatbots to predict dictator game decisions across 108 experiments with human\nparticipants from 12 countries. We find that only GPT-4 (not Bard nor Bing)\ncorrectly captures qualitative behavioral patterns, identifying three major\nclasses of behavior: self-interested, inequity-averse, and fully altruistic.\nNonetheless, GPT-4 consistently underestimates self-interest and\ninequity-aversion, while overestimating altruistic behavior.

To the best of our\nknowledge, our approach is the first to distinctly separate the reputational\nimpact on social media from the physical costs associated with negative ESG\ncontroversy news. Our results show that the occurrence of an ESG-risk event\nleads to a statistically significant average reduction of 0.29% in abnormal\nreturns.

        "abstract": "AI Alignment is often presented as an interaction between a single designer\nand an artificial agent in which the designer attempts to ensure the agent's\nbehavior is consistent with its purpose, and risks arise solely because of\nconflicts caused by inadvertent misalignment between the utility function\nintended by the designer and the resulting internal utility function of the\nagent. With the advent of agents instantiated with large-language models\n(LLMs), which are typically pre-trained, we argue this does not capture the\nessential aspects of AI safety because in the real world there is not a\none-to-one correspondence between designer and agent, and the many agents, both\nartificial and human, have heterogeneous values. Therefore, there is an\neconomic aspect to AI safety and the principal-agent problem is likely to\narise. In a principal-agent problem conflict arises because of information\nasymmetry together with inherent misalignment between the utility of the agent\nand its principal, and this inherent misalignment cannot be overcome by\ncoercing the agent into adopting a desired utility function through training.\nWe argue the assumptions underlying principal-agent problems are crucial to\ncapturing the essence of safety problems involving pre-trained AI models in\nreal-world situations. Taking an empirical approach to AI safety, we\ninvestigate how GPT models respond in principal-agent conflicts. We find that\nagents based on both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 override their principal's objectives in\na simple online shopping task, showing clear evidence of principal-agent\nconflict. Surprisingly, the earlier GPT-3.5 model exhibits more nuanced\nbehaviour in response to changes in information asymmetry, whereas the later\nGPT-4 model is more rigid in adhering to its prior alignment. Our results\nhighlight the importance of incorporating principles from economics into the\nalignment process.",

        "abstract": "The national legislation of many countries imposes restrictions on lending\nrates known as interest rate caps. In most cases, the effective (rather than\nnominal) interest rate is restricted, which includes all commissions and fees\nassociated with a loan. Typically, the generic wording of this restriction is\nambiguous in three respects. First, the literature provides several\nnonequivalent concepts of internal rate of return (IRR). Since the effective\ninterest rate is the IRR of the cash flow stream of a loan, the wording should\nspecify which concept of IRR is used. Second, most definitions of IRR are\npartial in the sense that there are cash flow streams that have no IRR. Thus,\nthe wording is vague for loans that have no IRR. Third, when loan advances and\nrepayments alternate in time, the respective roles of the borrower and lender\ncan be blurred. In this case, it is unclear to which of the parties of the loan\ncontract the regulatory measure should be addressed and, if it treats the\ncontract as illegal, which party should be brought to justice. This paper aims\nto resolve these ambiguities. We start by clarifying the concept of IRR. We\naxiomatize the conventional definition of IRR (as a unique root of the IRR\npolynomial) and show that any extension to a larger domain necessarily violates\na natural axiom. Given this result, we show how to derive an effective interest\nrate cap. We prove that there is a unique solution consistent with a set of\nreasonable conditions. Finally, we suggest a way to avoid the problem of\nidentification of the roles of the loan contract parties by imposing both a\nfloor and a ceiling on lending rates.",

We illustrate that\nthe companies using these strategies, Datalists, are challenging the existing\ndefinitions used within Monopoly Capital Theory (MCT). Datalists are pursuing a\ndifferent type of monopoly control than traditional multinational corporations.\nThey are pursuing monopolistic control over data to feed their productive\nprocesses, increasingly controlled by algorithms and Artificial Intelligence\n(AI). These productive processes use information about humans and the creative\noutputs of humans as the inputs but do not classify those humans as employees,\nso they are not paid or credited for their labour. This paper provides an\noverview of this evolution and its impact on monopoly theory. It concludes with\nan outline for a research agenda for economics in this space.",

Cooperating provides\nagents with evidence that other similar agents are likely to cooperate too,\nresulting in gains from trade for all.

The model incorporates uncertainty about others' value\nsystems and empirical situations, and addresses the problem of selecting a\ncompromise outcome. Using the model, I investigate issues with ECL and outline\nopen technical and philosophical questions.\n  I show that all cooperators must maximize the same weighted sum of utility\nfunctions to reach a Pareto optimal outcome. However, I argue against selecting\na compromise outcome implicitly by normalizing utility functions. I review\nbargaining theory and argue that the Nash bargaining solution could be a\nrelevant Schelling point. I introduce dependency equilibria (Spohn 2007), an\nequilibrium concept suitable for ECL, and generalize a folk theorem showing\nthat the Nash bargaining solution is a dependency equilibrium. I discuss gains\nfrom trade given uncertain beliefs about other agents and analyze how these\ngains decrease in several toy examples as the belief in another agent\ndecreases.\n  Finally, I discuss open issues in my model.

Earlier charging infrastructure optimization studies do not\nrigorously address such service disruption characteristics, resulting in\nsuboptimal infrastructure designs. To address this issue, we propose an\nefficient simulation-based optimization model that estimates candidate\nstations' service reliability and incorporates it into the objective function\nand constraints. We employ the control variates (CV) variance reduction\ntechnique to enhance simulation efficiency. Our model provides a highly robust\nsolution that buffers against uncertain electricity disruptions, even when\ncandidate station service reliability is subject to underestimation or\noverestimation. Using a dataset from Surabaya, Indonesia, our numerical\nexperiment demonstrates that the proposed model achieves a 13% higher average\nobjective value compared to the non-robust solution. Furthermore, the CV\ntechnique successfully reduces the simulation sample size up to 10 times\ncompared to Monte Carlo, allowing the model to solve efficiently using a\nstandard MIP solver. Our study provides a robust and efficient solution for\ndesigning EV charging infrastructure that can thrive even in developing\ncountries with uncertain electricity disruptions.",

On the basis of three recent papers,\nit presents an unconventional perspective on economic inequality from a\nstatistical physics point of view. One section demonstrates empirical evidence\nfor the exponential distribution of income in 67 countries around the world.\nThe exponential distribution was not familiar to mainstream economists until it\nwas introduced by physicists by analogy with the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution\nof energy and subsequently confirmed in empirical data for many countries.\nAnother section reviews the two-class structure of income distribution in the\nUSA. While the exponential law describes the majority of population (the lower\nclass), the top tail of income distribution (the upper class) is characterized\nby the Pareto power law, and there is no clearly defined middle class in\nbetween. As a result, the whole distribution can be very well fitted by using\nonly three parameters. Historical evolution of these parameters and inequality\ntrends are analyzed from 1983 to 2018. Finally, global inequality in energy\nconsumption and CO2 emissions per capita is studied using the empirical data\nfrom 1980 to 2017. Global inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient G,\nhas been decreasing until around 2010, but then saturated at the level G=0.5.\nThe saturation at this level was theoretically predicted on the basis of the\nmaximal entropy principle, well before the slowdown of the global inequality\ndecrease became visible in the data. This effect is attributed to accelerated\nmixing of the world economy due to globalization, which brings it to the state\nof maximal entropy and thus results in global economic stagnation. This\nobservation has profound consequences for social and geopolitical stability and\nthe efforts to deal with the climate change.",

        "abstract": "The relevance of Adam Smith for understanding human morality and sociality is\nrecognized in the growing interest in his work on moral sentiments among\nscholars of various academic backgrounds. But, paradoxically, Adam Smith's\ntheory of economic value enjoys a less prominent stature today among\neconomists, who, while they view him as the 'father of modern economics',\nconsidered him more as having had the right intuitions about a market economy\nthan as having developed the right concepts and the technical tools for\nstudying it. Yet the neoclassical tradition, which replaced the classical\nschool around 1870, failed to provide a satisfactory theory of market price\nformation. Adam Smith's sketch of market price formation (Ch. VII, Book I,\nWealth of Nations), and more generally the classical view of competition as a\ncollective higgling and bargaining process, as this paper argues, offers a\nhelpful foundation on which to build a modern theory of market price formation,\ndespite any shortcomings of the original classical formulation (notably its\ninsistence on long-run, natural value). Also, with hindsight, the experimental\nmarket findings established the remarkable stability, efficiency, and\nrobustness of the old view of competition, suggesting a rehabilitation of\nclassical price discovery. This paper reappraises classical price theory as\nAdam Smith articulated it; we explicate key propositions from his price theory\nand derive them from a simple model, which is an elementary sketch of the\nauthors' more general theory of competitive market price formation.",

We\ndeploy a semiparametric difference-in-differences approach with an event study\nspecification to test whether the lifting of these local moratoria led to an\nincrease in COVID-19 cases and deaths. Our main findings, across a range of\nspecifications, are inconclusive regarding the impact of the moratoria -\nespecially after accounting for the number of actual evictions and conducting\nthe analysis at the county level. We argue that recently developed augmented\nsynthetic control (ASCM) methods are more appropriate in this setting. Our ASCM\nresults also suggest that the lifting of eviction moratoria had little to no\nimpact on COVID-19 cases and deaths. Thus, it seems that eviction moratoria had\nlittle to no robust effect on reducing the spread of COVID-19 throwing into\nquestion its use as a non-pharmaceutical intervention.",

        "abstract": "Classical economics has developed an arsenal of methods, based on the idea of\nrepresentative agents, to come up with precise numbers for next year's GDP,\ninflation and exchange rates, among (many) other things. Few, however, will\ndisagree with the fact that the economy is a complex system, with a large\nnumber of strongly heterogeneous, interacting units of different types (firms,\nbanks, households, public institutions) and different sizes.\n  Now, the main issue in economics is precisely the emergent organization,\ncooperation and coordination of such a motley crowd of micro-units. Treating\nthem as a unique ``representative'' firm or household clearly risks throwing\nthe baby with the bathwater. As we have learnt from statistical physics,\nunderstanding and characterizing such emergent properties can be difficult.\nBecause of feedback loops of different signs, heterogeneities and\nnon-linearities, the macro-properties are often hard to anticipate. In\nparticular, these situations generically lead to a very large number of\npossible equilibria, or even the lack thereof.\n  Spin-glasses and other disordered systems give a concrete example of such\ndifficulties. In order to tackle these complex situations, new theoretical and\nnumerical tools have been invented in the last 50 years, including of course\nthe replica method and replica symmetry breaking, and the cavity method, both\nstatic and dynamic. In this chapter we review the application of such ideas and\nmethods in economics and social sciences. Of particular interest are the\nproliferation (and fragility) of equilibria, the analogue of satisfiability\nphase transitions in games and random economies, and condensation (or\nconcentration) effects in opinion, wealth, etc",

Using high-quality individual-level data on test\nscores and information on conflict-related violent events, a\ndifference-in-differences design is employed to estimate the conflict's causal\neffects. The results show that an increase in violent events and\nconflict-related deaths causes a significant decline in test scores in reading\nand mathematics. The conflict also leads to higher rates of teacher absenteeism\nand reduced access to electricity in schools. These findings highlight the\nadverse consequences of conflict-related violence on human capital\naccumulation, particularly within the Anglophone subsystem. The study\nemphasizes the disproportionate burden faced by Anglophone pupils due to\nlanguage-rooted tensions and segregated educational systems.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have shown a rapid adoption of residential solar PV with\nincreased self-consumption and self-sufficiency levels in Europe. A major\ndriver for their economic viability is the electricity tax exemption for the\nconsumption of self-produced electricity. This leads to large residential PV\ncapacities and partially overburdened distribution grids. Furthermore, the tax\nexemption that benefits wealthy households that can afford capital-intense\ninvestments in solar panels in particular has sparked discussions about energy\nequity and the appropriate taxation level for self-consumption. This study\ninvestigates the implementation of uniform electricity taxes on all\nconsumption, irrespective of the origin of the production, by means of a case\nstudy of 155,000 hypothetical Danish prosumers. The results show that the new\ntaxation policy redistributes costs progressively across household sizes. As\nmore consumption is taxed, the tax level can be reduced by 38%, leading to 61%\nof all households seeing net savings of up to 23% off their yearly tax bill.\nHigh-occupancy houses save an average of 116 Euro per year at the expense of\nsingle households living in large dwellings who pay 55 Euro per year more.\nImplementing a uniform electricity tax in combination with a reduced overall\ntax level can (a) maintain overall tax revenues and (b) increase the\ninteraction of batteries with the grid at the expense of behind-the-meter\noperations. In the end, the implicit cross-subsidy is removed by taxing\nself-consumption uniformly, leading to a cost redistribution supporting\noccupant-dense households and encouraging the flexible behavior of prosumers.\nThis policy measure improves economic efficiency and greater use of technology\nwith positive system-wide impacts.",

The findings confirm that the government is the institution for\nrealizing the common good according to scholastic attitude. Therefore,\nscholastic thinkers saw a common mission for the government based on their\nessentialist attitude toward human happiness. Social conflicts and lack of\nsocial consent are the product of diversification in ends and desires; hence,\nif the end of humans were unified, there would be no conflict of interest.\nAccordingly, if the government acts according to its assigned mission, the lack\nof public consent is not significant.

We challenge the Park et al. (2023) methodology and findings,\nprincipally around concerns of truncation bias and exclusion bias. We show that\n88 percent of the decrease in disruptive patents over 1980-2010 reported by the\nauthors can be explained by their truncation of all backward citations before\n1976. We also show that this truncation bias varies by technology class. We\nupdate the analysis to 2016 and account for a change in U.S. patent law that\nallows for citations to patent applications in addition to patent grants, which\nis ignored by the authors in their analysis. We show that the number of highly\ndisruptive patents has increased since 1980 -- particularly in IT technologies.\nOur results suggest caution in using the Park et al.

This study is\nbased on a survey conducted among students attending a Hungarian university of\napplied science in Western Transdanubia Region who have demonstrated their\nexisting entrepreneurial commitment by joining a national startup training and\nincubation programme. The main research question of the study is to what extent\nstudent entrepreneurship intention is influenced by the environment of the\nentrepreneurial university ecosystem and the support services available at the\nuniversity. A further question is whether these factors are able to mitigate\nthe negative effects of internal cognitive and external barriers by enhancing\nentrepreneurial attitudes and perceived behavioural control. The relatively\nlarge number of students involved in the programme allows the data to be\nanalysed using SEM modelling.

We use a fully randomized experiment of 427 trials,\nwhere Q-learning bidders participate in up to 250,000 auctions for a commonly\nvalued item. The findings reveal that the first price auction, where winners\npay the winning bid, is susceptible to coordinated bid suppression, with\nwinning bids averaging roughly 20% below the true values. In contrast, the\nsecond price auction, where winners pay the second highest bid, aligns winning\nbids with actual values, reduces the volatility during learning and speeds up\nconvergence. Regression analysis, incorporating design elements such as payment\nrules, number of participants, algorithmic factors including the discount and\nlearning rate, asynchronous/synchronous updating, feedback, and exploration\nstrategies, discovers the critical role of payment rules on efficiency.\nFurthermore, machine learning estimators find that payment rules matter even\nmore with few bidders, high discount factors, asynchronous learning, and coarse\nbid spaces. This paper underscores the importance of auction design in\nalgorithmic bidding. It suggests that computerized auctions like Google\nAdSense, which rely on the first price auction, can mitigate the risk of\nalgorithmic collusion by adopting the second price auction.",

        "abstract": "In spring 2022, the German federal government agreed on a set of policy\nmeasures that aimed at reducing households' financial burden resulting from a\nrecent price increase, especially in energy and mobility. These included among\nothers, a nationwide public transport ticket for 9~Euro per month for three\nmonths in June, July, and August 2022. In transport policy research this is an\nalmost unprecedented behavioral experiment. It allows us to study not only\nbehavioral responses in mode choice and induced demand but also to assess the\neffectiveness of these instruments. We observe this natural experiment with a\nthree-wave survey and a smartphone-based travel diary with passive tracking on\nan initial sample of 2,261 participants with a focus on the Munich metropolitan\nregion. This area is chosen as it offers a variety of mode options with a dense\nand far-reaching public transport network that even provides good access to\nmany leisure destinations. The app has been providing data from 756\nparticipants until the end of September, the three-wave survey by 1,402, and\nthe app and the three waves by 637 participants. In this paper, we report on\nthe study design, the recruitment and study participation as well as the\nimpacts of the policy measures on the self-reported and app-observed travel\nbehavior; we present results on consumer choices for a successor ticket to the\n9-Euro-Ticket that started in May 2023. We find a substantial shift in the\nmodal share towards public transport from the car in our sample during the\n9-Euro-Ticket period in travel distance (around 5 %) and in trip frequency\n(around 7 %). The mobility outcomes of the 9-Euro-Ticket however provide\nevidence that cheap public transport as a policy instrument does not suffice to\nincentive sustainable travel behavior choices and that other policy instruments\nare required in addition.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the functioning of modern payment systems through the\nlens of banks' maturity mismatch practices, and it examines the effects of\nbanks' refusal to roll over short-term interbank liabilities on financial\nstability. Within an agent-based stock-flow consistent framework, banks can\nengage in two segments of the interbank market that differ in maturity,\novernight and term. We compare two interbank matching scenarios to assess how\nbank-specific maturity targets, dependent on the dictates of the Net Stable\nFunding Ratio, impact the dynamics of the interbank market and the\neffectiveness of conventional monetary policies. The findings reveal that\nmaturity misalignment between deficit and surplus banks compromises the\ninterbank market's efficiency and increases reliance on the central bank's\nstanding facilities. Monetary policy interest-rate steering practices also\nbecome less effective. The study also uncovers a dual stability-based\nconfiguration in the banking sector, resembling the segmented European\ninterbank structure. This paper suggests that heterogeneous maturity mismatches\nbetween surplus and deficit banks may result in asymmetric funding frictions\nthat might precede credit- and sovereign-risk explanations of interbank\ntensions. Also, a combined examination of macroprudential tools and\nrollover-based interbank dynamics can enhance our understanding of how\nregulatory changes impact the stability of heterogeneous banking sectors.",

        "abstract": "This study explores the indirect impact of war damage on postwar fertility,\nwith a specific focus on Japan's air raids during World War II. Using 1935 and\n1947 Kinki region town/village data and city air raid damage information, we\nexplored the \"far-reaching effects\" on fertility rates in nearby undamaged\nareas. Our fixed-effects model estimates show that air raids influenced postwar\nfertility within a 15-kilometer radius of the bombed cities. These impacts\nvaried based on bombing intensity, showing both positive and negative effects.\nMoreover, a deeper analysis, using the Allied flight path as a natural\nexperiment, indicates that air raid threats and associated fear led to\nincreased postwar fertility, even in undamaged areas. This study highlights the\nrelatively unexplored indirect consequences of war on fertility rates in\nneighboring regions and significantly contributes to the literature on the\nrelationship between wars and fertility.",

Recently, increasing interest in academia have been raised on the risk\nand uncertainty analysis of closed-loop supply chain, yet there is no\ncomprehensive review paper focusing on closed-loop network design considering\nrisk and uncertainty. This paper examines previous research on the domain of\nclosed-loop network design under risk and uncertainties to provide constructive\nprospects for future study. We selected 106 papers published in the Scopus\ndatabase from the year 2004 to 2022. We analyse the source of risk and\nuncertainties of the CLSC network and identified appropriate methods for\nhandling uncertainties in addition to algorithms for solving uncertain CLSCND\nproblems. We also illustrate the evolution of objectives for designing a\nclosed-loop supply chain that is expos to risk or uncertainty, and investigate\nthe application of uncertain network design models in practical industry\nsectors. Finally, we draw proper research gaps for each category and clarify\nsome novel insights for future study. By considering the impacts of risk or\nuncertainties of different sources on closed-loop supply chain network design,\nwe can approach the economical, sustainable, social, and resilient objectives\neffectively and efficiently.",

This paper\nproposes an endogenous three-part model taking into account incidental\ntruncation and access restrictions to study demand for marijuana in Colombia,\nand analyze the potential effects of its legalization. Our application suggests\nthat modeling simultaneously access, intensive and extensive margin is\nrelevant, and that selection into access is important for the intensive margin.\nWe find that younger men that have consumed alcohol and cigarettes, living in a\nneighborhood with drug suppliers, and friends that consume marijuana face\nhigher probability of having access and using this drug. In addition, we find\nthat marijuana is an inelastic good (-0.45 elasticity). Our results are robust\nto different specifications and definitions. If marijuana were legalized,\nyounger individuals with a medium or low risk perception about marijuana use\nwould increase the probability of use in 3.8 percentage points, from 13.6% to\n17.4%. Overall, legalization would increase the probability of consumption in\n0.7 p.p. (2.3% to 3.0%).

Here, we derive an analytical solution to the\ndecision-making problem of storage operators who sell frequency regulation\npower to grid operators and trade electricity on day-ahead markets.\nMathematically, we treat future frequency deviation trajectories as functional\nuncertainties in a receding horizon robust optimization problem. We constrain\nthe expected terminal state-of-charge to be equal to some target to allow\nstorage operators to make good decisions not only for the present but also the\nfuture. Thanks to this constraint, the amount of electricity traded on\nday-ahead markets is an implicit function of the regulation power sold to grid\noperators. The implicit function quantifies the amount of power that needs to\nbe purchased to cover the expected energy loss that results from providing\nfrequency regulation. We show how the marginal cost associated with the\nexpected energy loss decreases with roundtrip efficiency and increases with\nfrequency deviation dispersion. We find that the profits from frequency\nregulation over the lifetime of energy-constrained storage devices are roughly\ninversely proportional to the length of time for which regulation power must be\ncommitted.",

        "abstract": "In Wyeth v. Levine the Supreme Court once again failed to reconcile the\ninterpretive presumption against preemption with the sometimes competing\nChevron doctrine of deference to agencies' reasonable statutory\ninterpretations. Rather than resolve the issue of which principle should govern\nwhere the two principles point toward opposite results, the Court continued its\nrecent practice of applying both principles halfheartedly, carving exceptions,\nand giving neither its proper weight.\n  This analysis situates Wyeth within the larger framework of the Court's\nrecent preemption decisions in an effort to explain the Court's hesitancy to\nresolve the conflict. The analysis concludes that the Court, motivated by its\nstrong respect for congressional intent and concern to protect federalism,\napplies both the presumption against preemption and the Chevron doctrine on a\nsliding scale. Where congressional intent to preempt is clear and vague only as\nto scope, the Court is usually quite deferential to agency determinations, but\nwhere congressional preemptive intent is unclear, agency views are accorded\nless weight.\n  The Court's variable approach to deference is defensible as necessary to\nprevent unauthorized incursion into areas of traditional state sovereignty, but\nits inherent unpredictability sows confusion among regulated parties, and the\nneed for flexibility prevents the Court from adopting any of the more\npredictable across-the-board approaches to deference proposed by the Court's\ncritics. A superior approach would combine the Court's concern for federalism\nwith the certainty of a bright-line rule by granting deference to agency views\nwhere Congress has spoken via a preemption clause of ambiguous scope and no\ndeference where Congress has remained silent.",

        "abstract": "Now almost three decades since its seminal Chevron decision, the Supreme\nCourt has yet to articulate how that case's doctrine of deference to agency\nstatutory interpretations relates to one of the most compelling federalism\nissues of our time: regulatory preemption of state law. Should courts defer to\npreemptive agency interpretations under Chevron, or do preemption's federalism\nimplications demand a less deferential approach? Commentators have provided no\nshortage of possible solutions, but thus far the Court has resisted all of\nthem.\n  This Article makes two contributions to the debate. First, through a detailed\nanalysis of the Court's recent agency-preemption decisions, I trace its\nhesitancy to adopt any of the various proposed rules to its high regard for\ncongressional intent where areas of traditional state sovereignty are at risk.\nRecognizing that congressional intent to delegate preemptive authority varies\nfrom case to case, the Court has hesitated to adopt an across-the-board rule.\nAny such rule would constrain the Court and risk mismatch with congressional\nintent -- a risk it accepts under Chevron generally but which it finds\nparticularly troublesome in the delicate area of federal preemption.\n  Second, building on this previously underappreciated factor in the Court's\nanalysis, I suggest a novel solution of variable deference that avoids the\ninflexibility inherent in an across-the-board rule while providing greater\npredictability than the Court's current haphazard approach. The proposed rule\nwould grant full Chevron-style deference in those cases where congressional\ndelegative intent is most likely -- where Congress has expressly preempted some\nstate law and the agency interpretation merely resolves preemptive scope --\nwhile withholding deference in those cases where Congress has remained\ncompletely silent as to preemption and delegative intent is least likely.",

Even though we may not care whether a company operates online or\nin the physical world, however, the question has dramatic consequences for the\ncompanies themselves. Online and offline entities are governed by different\nrules. Under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, online entities --\nbut not physical-world entities -- are immune from lawsuits related to content\nauthored by their users or customers. As a result, online entities have been\nable to avoid claims for harms caused by their negligence and defective product\ndesigns simply because they operate online.\n  The reason for the disparate treatment is the internet's dramatic evolution\nover the last two decades. The internet of 1996 served as an information\nrepository and communications channel and was well governed by Section 230,\nwhich treats internet entities as another form of mass media: Because Facebook,\nTwitter and other online companies could not possibly review the mass of\ncontent that flows through their systems, Section 230 immunizes them from\nclaims related to user content. But content distribution is not the internet's\nonly function, and it is even less so now than it was in 1996. The internet\nalso operates as a platform for the delivery of real-world goods and services\nand requires a correspondingly diverse immunity doctrine. This Article proposes\nrefining online immunity by limiting it to claims that threaten to impose a\ncontent-moderation burden on internet defendants. Where a claim is preventable\nother than by content moderation -- for example, by redesigning an app or\nwebsite -- a plaintiff could freely seek relief, just as in the physical world.\nThis approach empowers courts to identify culpable actors in the virtual world\nand treat like conduct alike wherever it occurs.",

Physical scientists have long proposed alternative but\ntestable energy cost theories of economic valuation, and have shown the gross\ncorrelation between energy consumption and economic output at the national\nlevel through input-output energy analysis. However, due to the difficulty of\nprecise energy analysis and highly complicated real markets, no decisive\nevidence directly linking energy costs to the selling prices of individual\ncommodities has yet been found. Over the past century, the US metal market has\naccumulated a huge body of price data, which for the first time ever provides\nus the opportunity to quantitatively examine the direct energy-value\ncorrelation. Here, by analyzing the market price data of 65 purified chemical\nelements (mainly metals) relative to the total energy consumption for refining\nthem from naturally occurring geochemical conditions, we found a clear\ncorrelation between the energy cost and their market prices. The underlying\nphysics we proposed has compatibility with conventional economic concepts such\nas the ratio between supply and demand or scarcity's role in economic\nvaluation.

        "abstract": "A recent analysis of scientific publication and patent citation networks by\nPark et al. (Nature, 2023) suggests that publications and patents are becoming\nless disruptive over time. Here we show that the reported decrease in\ndisruptiveness is an artifact of systematic shifts in the structure of citation\nnetworks unrelated to innovation system capacity. Instead, the decline is\nattributable to 'citation inflation', an unavoidable characteristic of real\ncitation networks that manifests as a systematic time-dependent bias and\nrenders cross-temporal analysis challenging. One driver of citation inflation\nis the ever-increasing lengths of reference lists over time, which in turn\nincreases the density of links in citation networks, and causes the disruption\nindex to converge to 0. A second driver is attributable to shifts in the\nconstruction of reference lists, which is increasingly impacted by\nself-citations that increase in the rate of triadic closure in citation\nnetworks, and thus confounds efforts to measure disruption, which is itself a\nmeasure of triadic closure. Combined, these two systematic shifts render the\ndisruption index temporally biased, and unsuitable for cross-temporal analysis.\nThe impact of this systematic bias further stymies efforts to correlate\ndisruption to other measures that are also time-dependent, such as team size\nand citation counts. In order to demonstrate this fundamental measurement\nproblem, we present three complementary lines of critique (deductive, empirical\nand computational modeling), and also make available an ensemble of synthetic\ncitation networks that can be used to test alternative citation-based indices\nfor systematic bias.",

We find\nthat in countries where labour markets are flexible (Australia, Canada, United\nKingdom and United States), unemployment rates typically return to\npre-recession levels, in line with Friedman s theory. Elsewhere, unemployment\nrates are less cyclical. Output recoveries differ less across countries, but\nmore across episodes: on average, half of the decline in GDP during a recession\npersists. In terms of sectors, declines in manufacturing are typically fully\nreversed. In contrast, construction-driven recessions, which are often\nassociated with bursting property price bubbles, tend to be persistent.",

        "abstract": "The economic shocks that followed the COVID-19 pandemic have brought to light\nthe difficulty, both for academics and policy makers, of describing and\npredicting the dynamics of inflation. This paper offers an alternative\nmodelling approach. We study the 2020-2023 period within the well-studied\nMark-0 Agent-Based Model, in which economic agents act and react according to\nplausible behavioural rules. We include a mechanism through which trust of\neconomic agents in the Central Bank can de-anchor. We investigate the influence\nof regulatory policies on inflationary dynamics resulting from three exogenous\nshocks, calibrated on those that followed the COVID-19 pandemic: a\nproduction/consumption shock due to COVID-related lockdowns, a supply-chain\nshock, and an energy price shock exacerbated by the Russian invasion of\nUkraine. By exploring the impact of these shocks under different assumptions\nabout monetary policy efficacy and transmission channels, we review various\nexplanations for the resurgence of inflation in the United States, including\ndemand-pull, cost-push, and profit-driven factors. Our main results are\nfour-fold: (i) without appropriate fiscal policy, the shocked economy can take\nyears to recover, or even tip over into a deep recession; {(ii) the success of\nmonetary policy in curbing inflation is primarily due to expectation anchoring,\nrather than to the direct economic impact of interest rate hikes; (iii)\nhowever, strong inflation anchoring is detrimental to consumption and\nunemployment, leading to a narrow window of ``optimal'' policy responses due to\nthe trade-off between inflation and unemployment;} (iv) the two most sensitive\nmodel parameters are those describing wage and price indexation. The results of\nour study have implications for Central Bank decision-making, and offers an\neasy-to-use tool that may help anticipate the consequences of different\nmonetary and fiscal policies.",

We use large-scale foot traffic\ndata for millions of places in 315 US cities between 2018 and 2020 to estimate\nan index of experienced isolation in daily visits between whites and other\nethnic groups. We find that heat increases segregation. Results from panel\nregressions imply that a week with temperatures above 33{\\deg}C in a city like\nLos Angeles induces an upward shift of visit isolation by 0.7 percentage\npoints, which equals about 14% of the difference in the isolation index of Los\nAngeles to the more segregated city of Atlanta.

Here, we evaluated Paris, France\nfor the decarbonization potentials of rooftop PV + EV in comparison to the\nsurrounding suburban area Ile-de-France and Kyoto, Japan.

The combination of EVs with PVs by V2H or V2B systems\nat the city or region level was found to be more effective in Ile-de-France\nthan in Paris suggesting that SolarEV City is more effective for geographically\nlarger area including Paris. If implemented at a significant scale, they can\nadd substantial values to rooftop PV economics and keep a high self-consumption\nand self-sufficiency, which also allows bypassing the classical battery storage\nthat is too expensive to be profitable. Furthermore, the systems potentially\nallow rapid CO2 emissions reduction; however, with already low-carbon\nelectricity of France by nuclear power, CO2 abatement (0.020 kgCO2kWh-1\nreduction from 0.063 kgCO2kWh-1) by PV + EV system can be limited, in\ncomparison to that (0.270 kgCO2kWh-1 reduction from 0.352 kgCO2kWh-1) of Kyoto,\nalso because of the Paris low insolation and high demands in higher latitude\nwinter.

Existing research shows\nthat applicants \"play the system\" by submitting school rankings strategically.\nWe investigate whether applicants also play the system by manipulating their\neligibility at schools. We analyze this applicant deception in a theoretical\nmodel and provide testable predictions for commonly-used admission procedures.\nWe confirm these model predictions empirically by analyzing the implementation\nof two reforms. First, we find that the introduction of a residence-based\nschool-admission criterion in Denmark caused address changes to increase by\nmore than 100% before the high-school application deadline. This increase\noccurred only in areas where the incentive to manipulate is high-powered.\nSecond, to assess whether this behavior reflects actual address changes, we\nstudy a second reform that required applicants to provide additional proof of\nplace of residence to approve an address change. The second reform\nsignificantly reduced address changes around the school application deadline,\nsuggesting that the observed increase in address changes mainly reflects\nmanipulation. The manipulation is driven by applicants from more affluent\nhouseholds and their behavior affects non-manipulating applicants.\nCounter-factual simulations show that among students not enrolling in their\nfirst listed school, more than 25% would have been offered a place in the\nabsence of address manipulation and their peer GPA is 0.2SD lower due to the\nmanipulative behavior of other applicants.

We\nthen extend this analysis to multi-player scenarios, introducing a new\nnumerical algorithm for its calculation. A key novelty of our work lies in\nusing regret minimization algorithms to solve continuous games through\ndiscretization. This groundbreaking approach enables us to incorporate\nadditional real-world factors like market frictions and risk correlations among\nfirms. We also experimentally validate that the Nash equilibrium in our model\nalso serves as a correlated equilibrium. Our findings illuminate how market\nfrictions and risk correlations affect strategic risk-taking.

We\nmake our methodology and open-source code available at\nhttps://github.com/louisabraham/cfrgame\n  Finally, we contribute methodologically by advocating the use of algorithms\nin economics, shifting focus from finite games to games with continuous action\nsets.

In order to investigate\neffects and evolution of wealth sharing, societies are simulated using a\nminimal model of a complex adapting system. These simulations demonstrate, for\nthis artificial foraging society, that local sharing of resources reduces the\neconomy's total wealth and increases wealth inequality. Evolutionary pressures\nstrongly select against local sharing, whether globally or within a\nindividual's clan, and select for asocial behaviors. By holding constant the\ngene for sharing resources among neighbors, from rich to poor, either with\neveryone or only within members of the same clan, social behavior is selected\nbut total wealth and mean age are substantially reduced relative to non-sharing\nsocieties. The Gini coefficient is shown to be ineffective in measuring these\nchanges in total wealth and wealth distributions, and, therefore, individual\nwell-being. Only with sociality do strategies emerge that allow sharing clans\nto exclude or coexist with non-sharing clans. These strategies are based on\nspatial effects, emphasizing the importance of modeling movement mediated\ncommunity assembly and coexistence as well as sociality.",

        "abstract": "This work validates a dynamic production network model, used to quantify the\nimpact of economic shocks caused by COVID-19 in the UK, using data for Belgium.\nBecause the model was published early during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, it\nrelied on several assumptions regarding the magnitude of the observed economic\nshocks, for which more accurate data have become available in the meantime. We\nrefined the propagated shocks to align with observed data collected during the\npandemic and calibrated some less well-informed parameters using 115 economic\ntime series. The refined model effectively captures the evolution of GDP,\nrevenue, and employment during the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium at both\nindividual economic activity and aggregate levels. However, the reduction in\nbusiness-to-business demand is overestimated, revealing structural shortcomings\nin accounting for businesses' motivations to sustain trade despite the\npandemic's induced shocks. We confirm that the relaxation of the stringent\nLeontief production function by a survey on the criticality of inputs\nsignificantly improved the model's accuracy. However, despite a large dataset,\ndistinguishing between varying degrees of relaxation proved challenging.\nOverall, this work demonstrates the model's validity in assessing the impact of\neconomic shocks caused by an epidemic in Belgium.",

By prioritizing SOSDIT, the EU can ensure that its\ncitizens are not left behind in the digital transformation process and that\ntechnology serves the needs of all Europeans. Therefore, the current study\naimed firstly to evaluate the SOSDIT of EU-27 countries and then to model its\nimportance in reaching sustainable development goals (SDGs). The current study,\nusing structural equation modeling, provided quantitative empirical evidence\nthat digital transformation in Finland, the Netherlands, and Denmark are\nrespectively most socially sustainable. It is also found that SOSDIT leads the\ncountries to have a higher performance in reaching SDGs. Finally, the study\nprovided evidence implying the inverse relationship between the Gini\ncoefficient and reaching SDGs. In other words, the higher the Gini coefficient\nof a country, the lower its performance in reaching SDGs. The findings of this\nstudy contribute to the literature of sustainability and digitalization. It\nalso provides empirical evidence regarding the SOSDIT level of EU-27 countries\nthat can be a foundation for the development of policies to improve the\nsustainability of digital transformation. According to the findings, this study\nprovides practical recommendations for countries to ensure that their digital\ntransformation is sustainable and has a positive impact on society.",

        "abstract": "Record linkage is a bedrock of quantitative social science, as analyses often\nrequire linking data from multiple, noisy sources. Off-the-shelf string\nmatching methods are widely used, as they are straightforward and cheap to\nimplement and scale. Not all character substitutions are equally probable, and\nfor some settings there are widely used handcrafted lists denoting which string\nsubstitutions are more likely, that improve the accuracy of string matching.\nHowever, such lists do not exist for many settings, skewing research with\nlinked datasets towards a few high-resource contexts that are not\nrepresentative of the diversity of human societies. This study develops an\nextensible way to measure character substitution costs for OCR'ed documents, by\nemploying large-scale self-supervised training of vision transformers (ViT)\nwith augmented digital fonts. For each language written with the CJK script, we\ncontrastively learn a metric space where different augmentations of the same\ncharacter are represented nearby. In this space, homoglyphic characters - those\nwith similar appearance such as ``O'' and ``0'' - have similar vector\nrepresentations. Using the cosine distance between characters' representations\nas the substitution cost in an edit distance matching algorithm significantly\nimproves record linkage compared to other widely used string matching methods,\nas OCR errors tend to be homoglyphic in nature. Homoglyphs can plausibly\ncapture character visual similarity across any script, including low-resource\nsettings. We illustrate this by creating homoglyph sets for 3,000 year old\nancient Chinese characters, which are highly pictorial. Fascinatingly, a ViT is\nable to capture relationships in how different abstract concepts were\nconceptualized by ancient societies, that have been noted in the archaeological\nliterature.",

Therefore, we hypothesize that locations along ownership\nchains are driven by the existence of communication costs to transmit\nmanagement decisions. In line with motivating evidence, we develop a\ntheoretical model for competition on corporate control that considers the\npossibility that parent companies in the origin countries can delegate their\nmonitoring activities in final subsidiaries to middlemen subsidiaries that are\nlocated in intermediate jurisdictions. Our model returns us a two-step\nempirical strategy with two gravity equations: i) a triangular gravity for\nestablishing a middleman by the parent, conditional on final investments'\nlocations; ii) a classical gravity for the location of final investments. First\nestimates confirm the predictions that ease of communication at the country\nlevel shapes the heterogeneous locations of subsidiaries along global ownership\nchains.",

Moreover, the estimated preference parameters of GPT are\nslightly different from human subjects and exhibit a lower degree of\nheterogeneity.

        "abstract": "This paper examines the monetary policies the Federal Reserve implemented in\nresponse to the Global Financial Crisis. More specifically, it analyzes the\nFederal Reserve's quantitative easing (QE) programs, liquidity facilities, and\nforward guidance operations conducted from 2007 to 2018. The essay's detailed\nexamination of these policies culminates in an interrupted time-series (ITS)\nanalysis of the long-term causal effects of the QE programs on U.S. inflation\nand real GDP. The results of this formal design-based natural experimental\napproach show that the QE operations positively affected U.S. real GDP but did\nnot significantly impact U.S. inflation. Specifically, it is found that, for\nthe 2011Q2-2018Q4 post-QE period, real GDP per capita in the U.S. increased by\nan average of 231 dollars per quarter relative to how it would have changed had\nthe QE programs not been conducted. Moreover, the results show that, in 2018Q4,\nten years after the beginning of the QE programs, real GDP per capita in the\nU.S. was 14% higher relative to what it would have been during that quarter had\nthere not been the QE programs. These findings contradict Williamson's (2017)\ninformal natural experimental evidence and confirm the conclusions of VARs and\nnew Keynesian DSGE models that the Federal Reserve's QE policies positively\naffected U.S. real GDP. The results suggest that the current U.S. and worldwide\nhigh inflation rates are likely not because of the QE programs implemented in\nresponse to the financial crisis that accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. They\nare likely due to the unprecedentedly large fiscal stimulus packages used, the\npeculiar nature of the financial downturn itself, the negative supply shocks\nfrom the war in Ukraine, or a combination of these factors. This paper is the\nfirst study to measure the macroeconomic effects of QE using a design-based\nnatural experimental approach.",

We introduce appropriate null models that filter out node\nheterogeneity and the strong effects of link reciprocity and find that, while\nthe aggregate network that overlays all products is characterized by a\nmultitude of triadic motifs, most single-product layers feature no significant\nmotif, and roughly $85\\%$ of the layers feature only two motifs or less.

Although various high level frameworks and\ndefinitions have been proposed to consolidate potential risks, practitioners\nstruggle with understanding and implementing them.\n  This lack of understanding exposes manufacturing to a multitude of risks,\nincluding the organisation, its workers, as well as suppliers and clients. In\nthis paper, we explore and interpret the applicability of responsible, ethical,\nand trustworthy AI within the context of manufacturing. We then use a broadened\nadaptation of a machine learning lifecycle to discuss, through the use of\nillustrative examples, how each step may result in a given AI trustworthiness\nconcern. We additionally propose a number of research questions to the\nmanufacturing research community, in order to help guide future research so\nthat the economic and societal benefits envisaged by AI in manufacturing are\ndelivered safely and responsibly.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a technological upheaval with the\npotential to change human society. Because of its transformative potential, AI\nis increasingly becoming subject to regulatory initiatives at the global level.\nYet, so far, scholarship in political science and international relations has\nfocused more on AI applications than on the emerging architecture of global AI\nregulation. The purpose of this article is to outline an agenda for research\ninto the global governance of AI. The article distinguishes between two broad\nperspectives: an empirical approach, aimed at mapping and explaining global AI\ngovernance; and a normative approach, aimed at developing and applying\nstandards for appropriate global AI governance. The two approaches offer\nquestions, concepts, and theories that are helpful in gaining an understanding\nof the emerging global governance of AI. Conversely, exploring AI as a\nregulatory issue offers a critical opportunity to refine existing general\napproaches to the study of global governance.",

        "abstract": "As the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to grow,\npolicymakers are increasingly grappling with the question of how to regulate\nthis technology. The most far-reaching international initiative is the European\nUnion (EU) AI Act, which aims to establish the first comprehensive, binding\nframework for regulating AI. In this article, we offer the first systematic\nanalysis of non-state actor preferences toward international regulation of AI,\nfocusing on the case of the EU AI Act. Theoretically, we develop an argument\nabout the regulatory preferences of business actors and other non-state actors\nunder varying conditions of AI sector competitiveness. Empirically, we test\nthese expectations using data from public consultations on European AI\nregulation. Our findings are threefold. First, all types of non-state actors\nexpress concerns about AI and support regulation in some form. Second, there\nare nonetheless significant differences across actor types, with business\nactors being less concerned about the downsides of AI and more in favor of lax\nregulation than other non-state actors. Third, these differences are more\npronounced in countries with stronger commercial AI sectors. Our findings shed\nnew light on non-state actor preferences toward AI regulation and point to\nchallenges for policymakers balancing competing interests in society.",

This pattern is difficult to\nreconcile with economic factors but can be explained by minimum payment\ninformation presented to consumers acting as an anchor that weighs payments\ndown. Building on Stewart (2009), we conduct a hypothetical credit card payment\nexperiment to test an intervention to de-anchor payment choices. This\nintervention effectively stops consumers selecting payments at the contractual\nminimum. It also increases their average payments, as well as shifting the\ndistribution of payments. By de-anchoring choices from the minimum, consumers\nincreasingly choose the full payment amount - which potentially seems to act as\na target payment for consumers. We innovate by linking the experimental\nresponses to survey responses on financial distress and to actual credit card\npayment behaviours. We find that the intervention largely increases payments\nmade by less financially-distressed consumers. We are also able to evaluate the\npotential external validity of our experiment and find that hypothetical\nresponses are closely related to consumers' actual credit card payments.",

This, in turn, sets another\nprecondition for data that are expected to not only be available and comply\nwith open data principles, but also be of value, i.e., of interest for reuse by\nthe end-user. This refers to the notion of 'high-value dataset' (HVD),\nrecognized by the European Data Portal as a key trend in the OGD area in 2022.\nWhile there is a progress in this direction, e.g., the Open Data Directive,\nincl. identifying 6 key categories, a list of HVDs and arrangements for their\npublication and re-use, they can be seen as 'core' / 'base' datasets aimed at\nincreasing interoperability of public sector data with a high priority,\ncontributing to the development of a more mature OGD initiative. Depending on\nthe specifics of a region and country - geographical location, social,\nenvironmental, economic issues, cultural characteristics, (under)developed\nsectors and market specificities, more datasets can be recognized as of high\nvalue for a particular country.

Recent advances in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) bring the opportunity to leverage textual data, such\nas earnings reports of publicly traded companies, to predict the return rate\nfor an asset. However, when dealing with such a sensitive task, the consistency\nof models -- their invariance under meaning-preserving alternations in input --\nis a crucial property for building user trust.

However, there is no agreed approach to\nassessing the sustainability of health systems. Moreover, social indicators are\nless developed and less succinct. Therefore, the authors seek to map\nsustainable reference values in healthcare and propose a conceptual and\nstructured framework that can guide the measurement of the social\nsustainability-oriented health systems. Based on a new multi-criteria method\ncalled Strong Sustainability Paradigm based Analytical Hierarchy Process,\n(SSP-AHP), the presented approach opens the availability for systems'\ncomparison and benchmarking. The Strong Sustainability Paradigm incorporated\ninto the multi-criteria evaluation method prevents the exchangeability of\ncriteria by promoting alternatives that achieve good performance values on all\ncriteria, implying sustainability. The research results offer insights into the\ncore domains, sub-domains, and indicators supporting a more comprehensive\nassessment of the social sustainability of health systems. The framework\nconstructed in this study consists of five major areas: equity, quality,\nresponsiveness, financial coverage, and adaptability. The proposed set of\nindicators can also serve as a reference instrument, providing transparency\nabout core aspects of performance to be measured and reported, as well as\nsupporting policy-makers in decisions regarding sectoral strategies in\nhealthcare. Our findings suggest that the most socially sustainable systems are\nNordic countries. They offer a high level of social and financial protection,\nachieving very good health outcomes.

We tested our research question by manipulating the part of our\nprompt which was used to create a simulated persona with different cooperative\nand competitive stances.

Our results provide evidence that\nLLMs can, to some extent, translate natural language descriptions of different\ncooperative stances into corresponding descriptions of appropriate task\nbehaviour, particularly in the one-shot game. There is some evidence of\nbehaviour resembling conditional reciprocity for the cooperative simulacra in\nthe repeated game, and for the later version of the model there is evidence of\naltruistic behaviour.

        "abstract": "The distributional impacts of congestion pricing have been widely studied in\nthe literature and the evidence on this is mixed. Some studies find that\npricing is regressive whereas others suggest that it can be progressive or\nneutral depending on the specific spatial characteristics of the urban region,\nexisting activity and travel patterns, and the design of the pricing scheme.\nMoreover, the welfare and distributional impacts of pricing have largely been\nstudied in the context of passenger travel whereas freight has received\nrelatively less attention. In this paper, we examine the impacts of several\nthird-best congestion pricing schemes on both passenger transport and freight\nin an integrated manner using a large-scale microsimulator (SimMobility) that\nexplicitly simulates the behavioral decisions of the entire population of\nindividuals and business establishments, dynamic multimodal network\nperformance, and their interactions. Through simulations of a prototypical\nNorth American city, we find that a distance-based pricing scheme yields the\nlargest welfare gains, although the gains are a modest fraction of toll\nrevenues (around 30\\%). In the absence of revenue recycling or redistribution,\ndistance-based and cordon-based schemes are found to be particularly\nregressive. On average, lower income individuals lose as a result of the\nscheme, whereas higher income individuals gain. A similar trend is observed in\nthe context of shippers -- small establishments having lower shipment values\nlose on average whereas larger establishments with higher shipment values gain.\nWe perform a detailed spatial analysis of distributional outcomes, and examine\nthe impacts on network performance, activity generation, mode and departure\ntime choices, and logistics operations.",

        "abstract": "Climate change poses new risks for real estate assets. Given that the\nmajority of home buyers use a loan to pay for their homes and the majority of\nthese loans are purchased by the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), it is\nimportant to understand how rising natural disaster risk affects the mortgage\nfinance market. The climate securitization hypothesis (CSH) posits that, in the\naftermath of natural disasters, lenders strategically react to the GSEs\nconforming loan securitization rules that create incentives that foster both\nmoral hazard and adverse selection effects. The climate risks bundled into GSE\nmortgage-backed securities emerge because of the complex securitization chain\nthat creates weak monitoring and screening incentives. We survey the recent\ntheoretical literature and empirical literature exploring screening incentive\neffects. Using regression discontinuity methods, we test key hypotheses\npresented in the securitization literature with a focus on securitization\ndynamics immediately after major hurricanes. Our evidence supports the CSH. We\naddress the data construction issues posed by LaCour-Little et. al. and show\nthat their concerns do not affect our main results. Under the current rules of\nthe game, climate risks exacerbates the established lemons problem commonly\nfound in loan securitization markets.",

Existing studies on mobility patterns have primarily\nfocused on regional aggregates in high-income countries, obfuscating the\naccentuated impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable populations.\nLeveraging geolocation data from mobile-phone users and population census for 6\nmiddle-income countries across 3 continents between March and December 2020, we\nuncovered common disparities in the behavioral response to the pandemic across\nsocioeconomic groups. Users living in low-wealth neighborhoods were less likely\nto respond by self-isolating, relocating to rural areas, or refraining from\ncommuting to work. The gap in the behavioral responses between socioeconomic\ngroups persisted during the entire observation period. Among users living in\nlow-wealth neighborhoods, those who commute to work in high-wealth\nneighborhoods pre-pandemic were particularly at risk of experiencing economic\nstress, facing both the reduction in economic activity in the high-wealth\nneighborhood and being more likely to be affected by public transport closures\ndue to their longer commute distances. While confinement policies were\npredominantly country-wide, these results suggest that, when data to identify\nvulnerable individuals are not readily available, GPS-based analytics could\nhelp design targeted place-based policies to aid the most vulnerable.",

        "abstract": "Sustainable water management has become an urgent challenge due to irregular\nwater availability patterns and water quality issues. The effect of climate\nchange exacerbates this phenomenon in water-scarce areas, such as the\nMediterranean region, stimulating the implementation of solutions aiming to\nmitigate or improve environmental, social, and economic conditions. A novel\nsolution inspired by nature, technology-oriented, explored in the past years,\nis constructed wetlands. Commonly applied for different types of wastewater due\nto its low cost and simple maintenance, they are considered a promising\nsolution to remove pollutants while creating an improved ecosystem by\nincreasing biodiversity around them. This research aims to assess the\nsustainability of two typologies of constructed wetlands in two Italian areas:\nSicily, with a vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland, and Emilia\nRomagna, with a surface flow constructed wetland. The assessment is performed\nby applying a cost-benefit analysis combining primary and secondary data\nsources. The analysis considered the market and non-market values in both\nproposed scenarios to establish the feasibility of the two options and identify\nthe most convenient one. Results show that both constructed wetlands bring more\nbenefits (benefits-cost ratio, BCR) than costs (BCR > 0). In the case of\nSicily, the BCR is lower (1) in the constructed wetland scenario, while in its\nabsence it is almost double. If other ecosystem services are included the\nconstructed wetland scenario reach a BCR of 4 and a ROI of 5, showing a better\nperformance from a costing perspective than the absence one. In Emilia Romagna,\nthe constructed wetland scenario shows a high BCR (10) and ROI (9), while the\nscenario in absence has obtained a negative present value indicating that the\ncost do not cover the benefits expected.",

Additionally, by referring to\nsome functional forms of well-being, I formulate the dependence of well-being\non narrow-wide WE. Finally, given that policies themselves have a plurality of\nsocial, ecological, and economic values, I define a set of policies for each of\nthe narrow-wide WE and consider a mapping between the two to provide an\nevaluation basis. Furthermore, by combining well-being and joint fact-finding\non the narrow-wide WE consensus, the policy evaluation method is formulated.\nThe fact-value combined parameter system, combined policy-making approach, and\ncombined impact evaluation are disclosed as examples of implementation.

        "abstract": "How does employer reputation affect the labor market? We investigate this\nquestion using a novel dataset combining reviews from Glassdoor.com and job\napplications data from Dice.com. Labor market institutions such as\nGlassdoor.com crowd-sources information about employers to alleviate\ninformation problems faced by workers when choosing an employer. Raw\ncrowd-sourced employer ratings are rounded when displayed to job seekers. By\nexploiting the rounding threshold, we identify the causal impact of Glassdoor\nratings using a regression discontinuity framework. We document the effects of\nsuch ratings on both the demand and supply sides of the labor market. We find\nthat displayed employer reputation affects an employer's ability to attract\nworkers, especially when the displayed rating is \"sticky.\" Employers respond to\nhaving a rating above the rounding threshold by posting more new positions and\nre-activating more job postings. The effects are the strongest for private,\nsmaller, and less established firms, suggesting that online reputation is a\nsubstitute for other types of reputation.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain enables peer-to-peer transactions in cyberspace without a trusted\nthird party. The rapid growth of Ethereum and smart contract blockchains\ngenerally calls for well-designed Transaction Fee Mechanisms (TFMs) to allocate\nlimited storage and computation resources. However, existing research on TFMs\nmust consider the waiting time for transactions, which is essential for\ncomputer security and economic efficiency. Integrating data from the Ethereum\nblockchain and memory pool (mempool), we explore how two types of events affect\ntransaction latency. First, we apply regression discontinuity design (RDD) to\nstudy the causal inference of the Merge, the most recent significant upgrade of\nEthereum. Our results show that the Merge significantly reduces the long\nwaiting time, network loads, and market congestion. In addition, we verify our\nresults' robustness by inspecting other compounding factors, such as censorship\nand unobserved delays of transactions via private changes. Second, examining\nthree major protocol changes during the merge, we identify block interval\nshortening as the most plausible cause for our empirical results. Furthermore,\nin a mathematical model, we show block interval as a unique mechanism design\nchoice for EIP1559 TFM to achieve better security and efficiency, generally\napplicable to the market congestion caused by demand surges. Finally, we apply\ntime series analysis to research the interaction of Non-Fungible token (NFT)\ndrops and market congestion using Facebook Prophet, an open-source algorithm\nfor generating time-series models. Our study identified NFT drops as a unique\nsource of market congestion -- holiday effects -- beyond trend and season\neffects. Finally, we envision three future research directions of TFM.",

        "abstract": "Travel time derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value\nfrom road travel times, serving as an underlying asset that cannot be directly\ntraded. Within the transportation domain, these derivatives are proposed as a\nmore comprehensive approach to value pricing. They enable road pricing based\nnot only on the level of travel time but also its volatility. In the financial\nmarket, travel time derivatives are introduced as innovative hedging\ninstruments to mitigate market risk, particularly in light of recent stress\nexperienced by the crypto market and traditional banking sector.\n  The paper focuses on three main aspects: (1) the motivation behind the\nintroduction of these derivatives, driven by the demand for hedging; (2)\nexploring the potential market for these instruments; and (3) delving into the\nproduct design and pricing schemes associated with them. The pricing schemes\nare devised by utilizing real-time travel time data captured by sensors. These\ndata are modeled using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and, more broadly,\ncontinuous time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) models. The calibration\nof these models is achieved through a hidden factor model, which describes the\ndynamics of travel time processes. The risk-neutral pricing principle is then\nemployed to determine the prices of the derivatives, employing well-designed\nprocedures to identify the market value of risk.",

Our analysis suggests a fully\nmediated pattern in the relationship between excessive land use regulations and\nemployment growth, with housing cost burden as the mediator. Specifically, a\none standard deviation increase in the WRLURI index is associated with an\napproximate increase of 0.8 percentage point in the proportion of cost burdened\nrenters. Relatedly, higher prevalence of cost-burdened renters has moderate\nadverse effects on employment growth in two sectors.

Any severe disturbance may induce a\nregime shift from continuous-cover to even-aged forestry.

Our analytical\ncriteria include robustness to the number of educational categories\ndistinguished and the negative association between intergenerational mobility\nand homophily. Additionally, we also impose an empirical criterion on the\nidentified qualitative historical trend in homophily between 1960 and 2010 in\nthe US at the national and sub-national levels.\n  Our analysis reveals that while a specific cardinal indicator meets all three\ncriteria, many commonly applied indices do not. We propose the application of\nthis well-performing indicator to quantify the trend in overall inequality in\nany country, including European countries, with available population data on\ncouples' education level.",

        "abstract": "Accurate, real-time measurements of price index changes using electronic\nrecords are essential for tracking inflation and productivity in today's\neconomic environment. We develop empirical hedonic models that can process\nlarge amounts of unstructured product data (text, images, prices, quantities)\nand output accurate hedonic price estimates and derived indices. To accomplish\nthis, we generate abstract product attributes, or ``features,'' from text\ndescriptions and images using deep neural networks, and then use these\nattributes to estimate the hedonic price function. Specifically, we convert\ntextual information about the product to numeric features using large language\nmodels based on transformers, trained or fine-tuned using product descriptions,\nand convert the product image to numeric features using a residual network\nmodel. To produce the estimated hedonic price function, we again use a\nmulti-task neural network trained to predict a product's price in all time\nperiods simultaneously. To demonstrate the performance of this approach, we\napply the models to Amazon's data for first-party apparel sales and estimate\nhedonic prices. The resulting models have high predictive accuracy, with $R^2$\nranging from $80\\%$ to $90\\%$. Finally, we construct the AI-based hedonic\nFisher price index, chained at the year-over-year frequency. We contrast the\nindex with the CPI and other electronic indices.",

        "abstract": "Great socio-economic transitions see the demise of certain industries and the\nrise of others. The losers of the transition tend to deploy a variety of\ntactics to obstruct change. We develop a political-economy model of interest\ngroup competition and garner evidence of tactics deployed in the global climate\nmovement. From this we deduce a set of strategies for how the climate movement\ncompetes against entrenched hydrocarbon interests. Five strategies for\novercoming obstructionism emerge: (1) Appeasement, which involves compensating\nthe losers; (2) Co-optation, which seeks to instigate change by working with\nincumbents; (3) Institutionalism, which involves changes to public institutions\nto support decarbonization; (4) Antagonism, which creates reputational or\nlitigation costs to inaction; and (5) Countervailance, which makes low-carbon\nalternatives more competitive. We argue that each strategy addresses the\nproblem of obstructionism through a different lens, reflecting a diversity of\nactors and theories of change within the climate movement. The choice of which\nstrategy to pursue depends on the institutional context.",

We argue that the premise under which the\nCBAA was historically justified is no longer valid due to a significant change\nin the local context. Namely, the environmental and social costs of coal energy\nare far more salient and the market has cleaner energy alternatives that are\ncost competitive. We recommend updating land acquisition laws to bring coal\nunder the general purview of LARR or, at minimum, amending the CBAA to ensure\nadequate environmental and social safeguards are in place, both in letter and\npractice.",

In this paper, we develop a\nstrategic network design model, named STraM, that explicitly incorporates these\nkey factors. STraM provides a network design plan that includes infrastructure\ninvestments and fuel technology decisions, aiming to achieve cost-effective\ndecarbonization of the freight transport system.

        "abstract": "The study of US-China relations has always been a crucial topic in our\neconomic development [4][5][7], and the US presidential election plays an\nintegral role in shaping these relations. The presidential election is held\nevery four years, and it is crucial to assess the impact of the 2020 election\non China to prepare for the potential effects of the 2024 US presidential\nelection on the Chinese economy [8][16][20]. To achieve this, we have gathered\nstatistical data from nearly 70 years and analyzed data related to the US\neconomy. We have classified the collected data and utilized the analytic\nhierarchy process [1][2][3] to evaluate the President's policy\nimplementation.This approach allowed us to obtain a comprehensive ranking of\nthe indicators [6][9][11][33]. We then quantified the index data and employed\nthe entropy weight method to calculate the weight of each index data. Finally,\nwe used the weighted total score calculation to evaluate the economic status of\nthe United States in a hierarchical manner after the election of Presidents\nTrump and Biden [15][18]. We optimized the index system by incorporating\nadditional dimension indexes such as \"foreign policy\". We then crawled China's\nspecific development data from 1990-2020 and substituted it into the model for\nanalysis and evaluation. This enabled us to obtain detailed quantitative index\ndata of the degree of influence [10][12][14]. To address China's shortcomings\nin science and technology innovation, we recommend strengthening economic\ncooperation with developed countries, diversifying market development, and\nactively expanding the domestic market through feasible solutions\n[13][16][23][36].",

Using natural language processing and k-mean clustering\non apps' text descriptions, I created a new variable that measures the\ndistinctiveness of an app as compared to its peers. I created four pricing\nvariables, price, cumulative installs, and indicators of whether an app\ncontains in-app ads and purchases. I found that the effect differs for\nsuccessful apps and less successful apps. I measure the success here using\ncumulative installs and the firms that developed the apps. Based on third-party\nrankings and the shape of the distribution of installs, I set two thresholds\nand divided apps into market-leading and market-follower apps. The\nmarket-leading sub-sample consists of apps with high cumulative installs or\ndeveloped by prestigious firms, and the market-follower sub-sample consists of\nthe rest of the apps. I found that the impact of being niche is smaller in the\nmarket-leading apps because of their relatively higher heterogeneity. In\naddition, being niche also impact utility apps differently from hedonic apps or\napps with two-sided market characteristics. For the special gaming category,\nbeing niche has some effect but is smaller than in the market follower\nsub-sample.

In 6th grade, primary\nschool teachers assign each student to a secondary school track. If a student\nscores above a track-specific cutoff on the standardized end-of-primary\neducation test, the teacher can upwardly revise this assignment. By comparing\nstudents just left and right of these cutoffs, we find that between 50-90% of\nthe students are \"trapped in track\": these students are on the high track after\nfour years, only if they started on the high track in first year. The remaining\n(minority of) students are \"always low\": they are always on the low track after\nfour years, independently of where they started. These proportions hold for\nstudents near the cutoffs that shift from the low to the high track in first\nyear by scoring above the cutoff. Hence, for a majority of these students the\ninitial (unrevised) track assignment decision is too low. The results replicate\nacross most of the secondary school tracks, from the vocational to the academic\ntracks, and stand out against an education system with a lot of upward and\ndownward track mobility.",

        "title": "Uncertainty over Uncertainty in Environmental Policy Adoption: Bayesian Learning of Unpredictable Socioeconomic Costs",
        "abstract": "The socioeconomic impact of pollution naturally comes with uncertainty due\nto, e.g., current new technological developments in emissions' abatement or\ndemographic changes. On top of that, the trend of the future costs of the\nenvironmental damage is unknown: Will global warming dominate or technological\nadvancements prevail? The truth is that we do not know which scenario will be\nrealised and the scientific debate is still open. This paper captures those two\nlayers of uncertainty by developing a real-options-like model in which a\ndecision maker aims at adopting a once-and-for-all costly reduction in the\ncurrent emissions rate, when the stochastic dynamics of the socioeconomic costs\nof pollution are subject to Brownian shocks and the drift is an unobservable\nrandom variable. By keeping track of the actual evolution of the costs, the\ndecision maker is able to learn the unknown drift and to form a posterior\ndynamic belief of its true value. The resulting decision maker's timing problem\nboils down to a truly two-dimensional optimal stopping problem which we address\nvia probabilistic free-boundary methods and a state-space transformation. We\ncompletely characterise the solution by showing that the optimal timing for\nimplementing the emissions reduction policy is the first time that the learning\nprocess has become ``decisive'' enough; that is, when it exceeds a\ntime-dependent percentage. This is given in terms of an endogenously determined\nthreshold function, which solves uniquely a nonlinear integral equation. We\nnumerically illustrate our results, discuss the implications of the optimal\npolicy and also perform comparative statics to understand the role of the\nrelevant model's parameters in the optimal policy.",

        "abstract": "Increasing the adoption of alternative technologies is vital to ensure a\nsuccessful transition to net-zero emissions in the manufacturing sector. Yet\nthere is no model to analyse technology adoption and the impact of policy\ninterventions in generating sufficient demand to reduce cost. Such a model is\nvital for assessing policy-instruments for the implementation of future energy\nscenarios. The design of successful policies for technology uptake becomes\nincreasingly difficult when associated market forces/factors are uncertain,\nsuch as energy prices or technology efficiencies. In this paper we formulate a\nnovel robust market potential assessment problem under uncertainty, resulting\nin policies that are immune to uncertain factors. We demonstrate two case\nstudies: the potential use of carbon capture and storage for iron and steel\nproduction across the EU, and the transition to hydrogen from natural gas in\nsteam boilers across the chemicals industry in the UK. Each robust optimisation\nproblem is solved using an iterative cutting planes algorithm which enables\nexisting models to be solved under uncertainty. By taking advantage of\nparallelisation we are able to solve the nonlinear robust market assessment\nproblem for technology adoption in times within the same order of magnitude as\nthe nominal problem. Policy makers often wish to trade-off certainty with\neffectiveness of a solution. Therefore, we apply an approximation to chance\nconstraints, varying the amount of uncertainty to locate less certain but more\neffective solutions. Our results demonstrate the possibility of locating robust\npolicies for the implementation of low-carbon technologies, as well as\nproviding direct insights for policy-makers into the decrease in policy\neffectiveness resulting from increasing robustness. The approach we present is\nextensible to a large number of policy design and alternative technology\nadoption problems.",

        "abstract": "We examine whether harvest-time transitory shifts in employment and income\nlead to changes in political violence and social unrest in rice-producing\ncroplands of Southeast Asia. Using monthly data from 2010 to 2023 on over\n86,000 incidents covering 376 one-degree cells across eight Southeast Asian\ncountries, we estimate a general increase in political violence and a decrease\nin social unrest in croplands with rice production during the harvest season\nrelative to the rest of the crop year. In a finding that is least sensitive to\nalternative model specifications and data subsetting, we estimate a nine\npercent increase in violence against civilians in locations with considerable\nrice production compared to other parts of the region during the harvest\nseason, relative to the rest of the year. We show that the harvest-time changes\nin conflict are most evident in rural cells with rainfed agriculture. Using\nlocation-specific annual variation in growing season rainfall, we then show\nthat the harvest-time increase in violence against civilians occurs in\npresumably good harvest years, whereas increase in battles between actors of\npolitical violence follows growing seasons with scarce rainfall. The\nharvest-time decrease in social unrest, protests in particular, occurs after\npresumably bad harvest years. These findings contribute to research on the\nagroclimatic and economic roots of conflict and offer insights to policymakers\nby suggesting the spatiotemporal concentration of conflict as well as diverging\neffects by forms of conflict at harvest time in the rice-producing regions of\nSoutheast Asia.",

        "abstract": "Income and wealth allocation are foundational components of how economies\noperate. These are complex distributions, and it is hard to get a real sense\nfor their dynamics using simplifications like average or median. One metric\nthat characterizes such distributions better is the Gini Index, which on one\nextreme is 0, a completely equitable distribution, and on the other extreme is\n1, the most inequitable, where a single individual has all the resources. Most\nexperts agree that viable economies cannot exist at either extreme, but\nidentifying a preferred range has historically been a matter of conflicting\npolitical philosophies and emotional appeals. This research explores instead\nwhether there might be a theoretical and empirical basis for a preferred Gini\nIndex. Specifically, I explore a simple question: Before financial systems\nexisted, how were natural assets allocated? Intrinsic human attributes such as\nheight, strength, & beauty were the original measures of value in which human\nsocial groups traded. Each of these attributes is distributed in a diverse and\ncharacteristic way, which I propose has gradually established the acceptable\nbounds of inequality through evolutionary psychology. I collect data for a wide\narray of such traits and calculate a Gini Index for them in a novel way\nassuming their magnitudes to be analogous to levels of financial wealth. The\nvalues fall into a surprisingly intuitive pattern ranging from Gini=0.02 to\n0.51. Income distributions in many countries are within the top half of this\nrange after taxes and transfers are applied (0.2 to 0.4). Wealth distributions\non the other hand are mostly outside of this range, with the United States at a\nvery inequitable 0.82. Additional research is needed on the interconnections\nbetween this range of \"natural\" Gini Indexes and human contentment; and whether\nany explicit policy goals should be considered to target them.",

        "abstract": "Emissions pathways used in climate policy analysis are often derived from\nintegrated assessment models. However, such emissions pathways do not typically\ninclude climate feedbacks on socioeconomic systems and by extension do not\nconsider climate uncertainty in their construction. We use a well-known\ncost-benefit integrated assessment model, the Dynamic Integrated\nClimate-Economy (DICE) model, with its climate component replaced by the\nFinite-amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) model (v2.1). The climate uncertainty\nin FaIR is sampled with an ensemble that is consistent with historically\nobserved climate and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessed\nranges of key climate variables such as equilibrium climate sensitivity. Three\nscenarios are produced: a pathway similar to the \"optimal welfare\" scenario of\nDICE that has similar warming outcomes to current policies, and pathways that\nlimit warming to \"well-below\" 2C and 1.5C with low overshoot, in line with\nParis Agreement long-term temperature goals. Climate uncertainty alone is\nresponsible for a factor of five variation (5-95% range) in the social cost of\ncarbon in the 1.5C scenario. CO2 emissions trajectories resulting from the\noptimal level of emissions abatement in all pathways are also sensitive to\nclimate uncertainty, with 2050 emissions ranging from -12 to +14 GtCO2/yr in\nthe 1.5C scenario. Equilibrium climate sensitivity and the strength of\npresent-day aerosol effective radiative forcing are strong determinants of\nsocial cost of carbon and mid-century CO2 emissions. This shows that narrowing\nclimate uncertainty leads to more refined estimates for the social cost of\ncarbon and provides more certainty about the optimal rate of emissions\nabatement. Including climate and climate uncertainty in integrated assessment\nmodel derived emissions scenarios would address a key missing feedback in\nscenario construction.",

Implicit in these functions lies an unwarranted\nassumption that restricts the spatial variation (Svar) and temporal variability\n(Tvar) of changes in climate to be null. This could bias damage estimates and\nthe climate policy advice from IAMs. While the effects of Tvar have been\nstudied in the literature, those of Svar and their interactions with Tvar have\nnot. Here we present estimates of the economic costs of climate change that\naccount for both Tvar and Svar, as well as for the seasonality of damages\nacross sectors. Contrary to the results of recent studies which show little\neffect that of Tvar on expected losses, we reveal that ignoring Svar produces\nlarge downward biases, as warming is highly heterogeneous over space. Using a\nconservative calibration for the damage function, we show that previous\nestimates are biased downwards by about 23-36%, which represents additional\nlosses of about US$1,400-US$2,300 billion by 2050 and US$17-US$28 trillion by\nthe end of the century, under a high emissions scenario.

The\nproduction of tea has changed significantly in India over the years, moving\nmore and more towards organic and sustainable practices. The industry has also\nhad to deal with difficulties like competition from other nations that produce\ntea, varying tea prices, and labor-related problems. Despite these obstacles,\nthe Indian tea business is still growing and produces a wide variety of teas,\nsuch as black tea, green tea, and chai tea. Additionally, the sector encourages\ntravel through \"tea tourism,\" which allows tourists to see how tea is made and\ndiscover its origins in India. Overall, India's tea business continues to play\na significant role in its history, culture, and economy.",

Despite significant\ninvestments in their widespread adoption, there remain large gaps in our\nunderstanding of the efficacy of EWS, and the role of statistical risk scores\nin education.\n  In this work, we draw on nearly a decade's worth of data from a system used\nthroughout Wisconsin to provide the first large-scale evaluation of the\nlong-term impact of EWS on graduation outcomes. We present empirical evidence\nthat the prediction system accurately sorts students by their dropout risk. We\nalso find that it may have caused a single-digit percentage increase in\ngraduation rates, though our empirical analyses cannot reliably rule out that\nthere has been no positive treatment effect.\n  Going beyond a retrospective evaluation of DEWS, we draw attention to a\ncentral question at the heart of the use of EWS: Are individual risk scores\nnecessary for effectively targeting interventions? We propose a simple\nmechanism that only uses information about students' environments -- such as\ntheir schools, and districts -- and argue that this mechanism can target\ninterventions just as efficiently as the individual risk score-based mechanism.\nOur argument holds even if individual predictions are highly accurate and\neffective interventions exist. In addition to motivating this simple targeting\nmechanism, our work provides a novel empirical backbone for the robust\nqualitative understanding among education researchers that dropout is\nstructurally determined. Combined, our insights call into question the marginal\nvalue of individual predictions in settings where outcomes are driven by high\nlevels of inequality.",

        "abstract": "Many applications require linking individuals, firms, or locations across\ndatasets. Most widely used methods, especially in social science, do not employ\ndeep learning, with record linkage commonly approached using string matching\ntechniques. Moreover, existing methods do not exploit the inherently multimodal\nnature of documents. In historical record linkage applications, documents are\ntypically noisily transcribed by optical character recognition (OCR). Linkage\nwith just OCR'ed texts may fail due to noise, whereas linkage with just image\ncrops may also fail because vision models lack language understanding (e.g., of\nabbreviations or other different ways of writing firm names). To leverage\nmultimodal learning, this study develops CLIPPINGS (Contrastively LInking\nPooled Pre-trained Embeddings). CLIPPINGS aligns symmetric vision and language\nbi-encoders, through contrastive language-image pre-training on document images\nand their corresponding OCR'ed texts. It then contrastively learns a metric\nspace where the pooled image-text embedding for a given instance is close to\nembeddings in the same class (e.g., the same firm or location) and distant from\nembeddings of a different class. Data are linked by treating linkage as a\nnearest neighbor retrieval problem with the multimodal embeddings. CLIPPINGS\noutperforms widely used string matching methods by a wide margin in linking\nmid-20th century Japanese firms across financial documents. A purely\nself-supervised model - trained only by aligning the embeddings for the image\ncrop of a firm name and its corresponding OCR'ed text - also outperforms\npopular string matching methods. Fascinatingly, a multimodally pre-trained\nvision-only encoder outperforms a unimodally pre-trained vision-only encoder,\nillustrating the power of multimodal pre-training even if only one modality is\navailable for linking at inference time.",

        "abstract": "The scale and terms of aggregate borrowing in an economy depend on the manner\nin which wealth is distributed across potential creditors with heterogeneous\nbeliefs about the future. This distribution evolves over time as uncertainty is\nresolved, in favour of optimists if loans are repaid in full, and in favour of\npessimists if there is widespread default. We model this process in an economy\nwith two assets - risky bonds and risk-free cash. Within periods, given the\ninherited distribution of wealth across belief types, the scale and terms of\nborrowing are endogenously determined. Following good states, aggregate\nborrowing and the face value of debt both rise, and the interest rate falls. In\nthe absence of noise, wealth converges to beliefs that differ systematically\nfrom the objective probability governing state realisations, with greater\nrisk-aversion associated with greater optimism. In the presence of noise, the\neconomy exhibits periods of high performance, punctuated by periods of crisis\nand stagnation.",

        "abstract": "The existing buildings and building construction sectors together are\nresponsible for over one-third of the total global energy consumption and\nnearly 40% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. GHG emissions from the\nbuilding sector are made up of embodied emissions and operational emissions.\nRecognizing the importance of reducing energy use and emissions associated with\nthe building sector, governments have introduced policies, standards, and\ndesign guidelines to improve building energy performance and reduce GHG\nemissions associated with operating buildings. However, policy initiatives that\nreduce embodied emissions of the existing building sector are lacking. This\nresearch aims to develop policy strategies to reduce embodied carbon emissions\nin retrofits. In order to achieve this goal, this research conducted a\nliterature review and identification of policies and financial incentives in\nBritish Columbia (BC) for reducing overall GHG emissions from the existing\nbuilding sector. Then, this research analyzed worldwide policies and incentives\nthat reduce embodied carbon emissions in the existing building sector. After\nreviewing the two categories of retrofit policies, the author identified links\nand opportunities between existing BC strategies, tools, and incentives, and\nglobal embodied emission strategies. Finally, this research compiled key\nfindings from all resources and provided policy recommendations for reducing\nembodied carbon emissions in retrofits in BC.",

        "abstract": "March 2020 confinement has shot Portuguese savings to historic levels,\nreaching 13.4% of gross disposable income in early 2021 (INE, 2023). To find\nsimilar savings figures we need to go back to 1999. With consumption reduced to\na bare minimum, the Portuguese were forced to save. Households reduced spending\nmore because of a lack of alternatives to consumption than for any other\nreason. The relationship between consumption, savings, and income has occupied\nan important role in economic thought [(Keynes, 1936; 1937); (Friedman, 1957)].\nTraditionally, high levels of savings have been associated with benefits to the\neconomy, since financing capacity is enhanced (Singh, 2010). However, the\neffects here can be twofold. On the one hand, it seems that Portugal faced the\nso-called Savings Paradox (Keynes, 1936). If consumers decide to save a\nconsiderable part of their income, there will be less demand for the goods\nproduced. Lower demand will lead to lower supply, production, income, and,\nparadoxically, fewer savings. On the other hand, after having accumulated\nsavings at the peak of the pandemic, the Portuguese are now using them to carry\nout postponed consumption and, hopefully, to better resist the escalating\ninflation. This study aims to examine Portuguese households' savings evolution\nduring the most critical period of the pandemic, between March 2020 and April\n2022. The methodology analyses the correlation between savings, consumption,\nand GDP as well as GDP's decomposition into its various components and\nconcluded that these suddenly forced savings do not fit traditional economic\ntheories of savings.",

We find a negative\nrelationship between income and fertility for women aged 20-29 that persists\nfor women aged 30 and over. This result suggests that having children is\nperceived as an opportunity cost for women in this age group. We also observe a\nnegative relationship between education and adolescent fertility, which has\nimplications for the design of public policies. A panel data analysis with\neconometric techniques allowing us to control for unobserved heterogeneity\nconfirms that income is a relevant factor for all groups of women and\nreinforces the crucial role of education in reducing teenage fertility. We also\nidentify a negative correlation between fertility and employment rates for\nwomen aged 30 and above.

        "abstract": "Abundant evidence has tracked the labour market and health assimilation of\nimmigrants, including static analyses of differences in how foreign-born and\nnative-born residents consume health care services. However, we know much less\nabout how migrants' patterns of health care usage evolve with time of\nresidence, especially in countries providing universal or quasi-universal\ncoverage. We investigate this process in Spain by combining all the available\nwaves of the local health survey, which allows us to separately identify\nperiod, cohort, and assimilation effects. We find that the evidence of health\nassimilation is limited and solely applies to migrant females' visits to\ngeneral practitioners. Nevertheless, the differential effects of ageing on\nhealth care use between foreign-born and native-born populations contributes to\nthe convergence of utilisation patterns in most health services after 20 years\nin Spain. Substantial heterogeneity over time and by region of origin both\nsuggest that studies modelling future welfare state finances would benefit from\na more thorough assessment of migration.",

This study aims to provide a roadmap for existing\nmid-rise building retrofits in order to understand the required capital\ninvestment, energy savings, energy cost savings, and carbon footprint for\nmid-rise residential buildings in Canada. This study employed EnergyPlus to\nexamine the energy performance of 11 energy retrofit measures for a typical\nmulti-unit residential building (MURB) in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia,\nCanada. The author employed the energy simulation software (EnergyPlus) to\nevaluate the pre-and post-retrofit operational energy performance of the\nselected MURB. Two base building models powered by natural gas (NG-building)\nand electricity (E-building) were created by SketchUP. The energy simulation\nresults were combined with cost and emission impact data to evaluate the\neconomic and environmental performance of the selected energy retrofit\nmeasures. The results indicated that the NG-building can produce significant\nGHG emission reductions (from 27.64 tCO2e to 3.77 tCO2e) by implementing these\nenergy retrofit measures. In terms of energy savings, solar PV, ASHP, water\nheater HP, and HRV enhancement have great energy saving potential compared to\nother energy retrofit measures. In addition, temperature setback, lighting, and\nairtightness enhancement present the best economic performance from a life\ncycle perspective. However, windows, ASHP, and solar PV, are not economical\nchoices because of higher life cycle costs. While ASHP can increase life cycle\ncosts for the NG-building, with the financial incentives provided by the\ngovernments, ASHP could be the best choice to reduce GHG emissions when\nstakeholders make decisions on implementing energy retrofits.",

Due to the network\nstructure of supply chains and the sampling process of firms and links,\nquantities relying on the number of customers firms have (out-degrees) are\nharder to reconstruct.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a general equilibrium model for multi-passenger\nridesharing systems, in which interactions between ridesharing drivers,\npassengers, platforms, and transportation networks are endogenously captured.\nStable matching is modeled as an equilibrium problem in which no ridesharing\ndriver or passenger can reduce ridesharing disutility by unilaterally switching\nto another matching sequence. This paper is one of the first studies that\nexplicitly integrates the ridesharing platform multi-passenger matching problem\ninto the model. By integrating matching sequence with hyper-network,\nridesharing-passenger transfers are avoided in a multi-passenger ridesharing\nsystem. Moreover, the matching stability between the ridesharing drivers and\npassengers is extended to address the multi-OD multi-passenger case in terms of\nmatching sequence. The paper provides a proof for the existence of the proposed\ngeneral equilibrium. A sequence-bush algorithm is developed for solving the\nmulti-passenger ridesharing equilibrium problem. This algorithm is capable to\nhandle complex ridesharing constraints implicitly. Results illustrate that the\nproposed sequence-bush algorithm outperforms general-purpose solver, and\nprovides insights into the equilibrium of the joint stable matching and route\nchoice problem. Numerical experiments indicate that ridesharing trips are\ntypically longer than average trip lengths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that\na properly designed ridesharing unit price is necessary to achieve network\nbenefits, and travelers with relatively lower values of time are more likely to\nparticipate in ridesharing.",

Aiming to protect\nconsumers and guarantee fair competition on platforms, legislators increasingly\nrequire that recommendations on market-dominating platforms be free from\nself-preferencing. That is, platforms that also act as sellers (e.g., Amazon)\nor information providers (e.g., Google) must not prefer their own offers over\ncomparable third-party offers. Yet, successful enforcement of self-preferencing\nbans -- to the potential benefit of consumers and third-party actors --\nrequires defining and measuring self-preferencing across a platform. In the\ncontext of recommendations through search results, this research contributes by\ni) conceptualizing a \"recommendation\" as an offer's level of search engine\nvisibility across an entire platform (instead of its position in specific\nsearch queries, as in previous research); ii) discussing two tests for\nself-preferencing, and iii) implementing them in two empirical studies across\nthree international Amazon marketplaces. Contrary to consumer expectations and\nemerging literature, our analysis finds almost no evidence for\nself-preferencing. A survey reveals that even if Amazon were proven to engage\nin self-preferencing, most consumers would not change their shopping behavior\non the platform -- highlighting Amazon's significant market power and\nsuggesting the need for robust protections for sellers and consumers.",

        "abstract": "Contemporary deep learning based solution methods used to compute approximate\nequilibria of high-dimensional dynamic stochastic economic models are often\nfaced with two pain points. The first problem is that the loss function\ntypically encodes a diverse set of equilibrium conditions, such as market\nclearing and households' or firms' optimality conditions. Hence the training\nalgorithm trades off errors between those -- potentially very different --\nequilibrium conditions. This renders the interpretation of the remaining errors\nchallenging. The second problem is that portfolio choice in models with\nmultiple assets is only pinned down for low errors in the corresponding\nequilibrium conditions. In the beginning of training, this can lead to\nfluctuating policies for different assets, which hampers the training process.\nTo alleviate these issues, we propose two complementary innovations. First, we\nintroduce Market Clearing Layers, a neural network architecture that\nautomatically enforces all the market clearing conditions and borrowing\nconstraints in the economy. Encoding economic constraints into the neural\nnetwork architecture reduces the number of terms in the loss function and\nenhances the interpretability of the remaining equilibrium errors. Furthermore,\nwe present a homotopy algorithm for solving portfolio choice problems with\nmultiple assets, which ameliorates numerical instabilities arising in the\ncontext of deep learning. To illustrate our method we solve an overlapping\ngenerations model with two permanent risk aversion types, three distinct\nassets, and aggregate shocks.",

The increasing dominance of\ngrant-supported research in shaping scientific advances, coupled with growing\ninterest in funding interdisciplinary work, raises fundamental questions about\nthe effectiveness of interdisciplinary grants in fostering high-impact\ninterdisciplinary research outcomes. Here, we quantify the interdisciplinarity\nof both research grants and publications, capturing 350,000 grants from 164\nfunding agencies across 26 countries and 1.3 million papers that acknowledged\ntheir support from 1985 to 2009.

We demonstrate that the key to explaining this\nparadox lies in the power of disciplinary grants in propelling high-impact\ninterdisciplinary research. Specifically, our results show that highly\ninterdisciplinary papers supported by deeply disciplinary grants garner\ndisproportionately more citations, both within their core disciplines and from\nbroader fields. Moreover, disciplinary grants, particularly when combined with\nother similar grants, are more effective in producing high-impact\ninterdisciplinary research.

On\nearly works, the paper expands the number of divisions by one downstream\ndivision and relaxes basic assumptions, such as the assumption of common\nknowledge of rationality. Based on an agent-based simulation, it is examined\nwhether cognitively bounded individuals modeled by fuzzy Q-learning achieve the\nsame results as fully rational utility maximizers. In addition, the paper\ninvestigates different constellations of bargaining power to see whether a\ndeviation from the recommended optimal bargaining power leads to a higher\nmanagerial performance. The simulation results show that fuzzy Q-learning\nagents perform at least as well or better than fully individual rational\nutility maximizers. The study also indicates that, in scenarios with different\nmarginal costs of divisions, a deviation from the recommended optimal\ndistribution ratio of the bargaining power of divisions can lead to higher\ninvestment levels and, thus, to an increase in the headquarters' profit.",

        "abstract": "With 70 million dead, World War II remains the most devastating conflict in\nhistory. Of the survivors, millions were displaced, returned maimed from the\nbattlefield, or spent years in captivity. We examine the impact of such wartime\nexperiences on labor market careers and show that they often become apparent\nonly at certain life stages. While war injuries reduced employment in old age,\nformer prisoners of war postponed their retirement. Many displaced workers,\nparticularly women, never returned to employment. These responses are in line\nwith standard life-cycle theory and thus likely extend to other conflicts.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the nature of the density metric, which is\nemployed in the literature on smart specialization and the product space. We\nfind that although density is supposed to capture relatedness between a\ncountry's current specialization pattern and potential products that it may\ndiversify into, density is also correlated strongly to the level of\ndiversification of the country, and (less strongly) to the ubiquity of the\nproduct. Together, diversity and ubiquity capture 93% of the variance of\ndensity. We split density into a part that corresponds to related variety, and\na part that does not (i.e., unrelated variety). In regressions for predicting\ngain or loss of specialization, both these parts are significant. The relative\ninfluence of related variety increases with the level of diversification of the\ncountry: only countries that are already diversified show a strong influence of\nrelated variety. In our empirical analysis, we put equal emphasis on gains and\nlosses of specialization. Our data show that the specializations that were lost\nby a country often represented higher product complexity than the\nspecializations that were gained over the same period. This suggests that\n'smart' specialization should be aimed at preserving (some) existing\nspecializations in addition to gaining new ones. Our regressions indicate that\nthe relative roles of related and unrelated variety for explaining loss of\nspecialization are similar to the case of specialization gains. Finally, we\nalso show that unrelated variety is also important in indicators that are\nderived from density, such as the Economic Complexity Outlook Index.",

Through a quantitative approach,\nthis article discusses the weight of foreign suppliers' involvement in federal\nbidding between 2011 and 2018. To this end, a literature review was conducted\non public procurement and international biddings. Besides, an extensive data\nsearch was achieved through the Federal Government Procurement Panel. The\nresults showed that between 2011 and 2018, more than R\\$ 422.6 billion was\nconfirmed in public procurement processes, and of this total, about R\\$ 28.9\nbillion was confirmed to foreign suppliers. The Ministry of Health accounted\nfor approximately 88.67% of these confirmations. The Invitation, Competition\nand International Competition modalities accounted for 0.83% of the amounts\nconfirmed to foreign suppliers. Impossible Bidding, Waived Bidding, and Reverse\nAuction modalities accounted for 99.17% of the confirmed quantities to foreign\nsuppliers. Based on the discussion of the results and the limitations found,\nsome directions for further studies and measures to increase public resources\nexpenditures' effectiveness and efficiency are suggested.",

Using\ndata from a global e-commerce platform, we apply regression discontinuity\ndesign to causally examine the effects of product recommendations on online\ninvestors' mutual fund investments. Our findings indicate that recommended\nfunds experience a significant rise in purchases, especially among low\nsocioeconomic status investors who are most influenced by these\nrecommendations. However, investors tend to suffer significantly worse\ninvestment returns after purchasing recommended funds, and this negative impact\nis also most significant for investors with low socioeconomic status. To\nexplain this disparity, we find investors tend to gather less information and\nexpend reduced effort in fund research when buying recommended funds.\nFurthermore, investors' redemption timing of recommended funds is less optimal\nthan non-recommended funds. We also find that recommended funds experience a\nlarger return reversal than non-recommended funds. In conclusion, product\nrecommendations make investors behave more irrationally and these negative\nconsequences are most significant for investors with low socioeconomic status,\nwhich can amplify wealth inequality among investors in financial markets.",

To examine quality outcomes, I\nuse a set of scraped data and repeat this difference-in-differences\nidentification strategy for complaints resulting in censure against physicians\nin Ontario.\n  I find declines in the number of primary care providers by 5% for up to nine\nyears after the policy change.

I find no impacts on quality\nof physician as measured by public censure of physicians.

        "abstract": "Transforming food systems is essential to bring about a healthier, equitable,\nsustainable, and resilient future, including achieving global development and\nsustainability goals. To date, no comprehensive framework exists to track food\nsystems transformation and their contributions to global goals. In 2021, the\nFood Systems Countdown to 2030 Initiative (FSCI) articulated an architecture to\nmonitor food systems across five themes: 1 diets, nutrition, and health; 2\nenvironment, natural resources, and production; 3 livelihoods, poverty, and\nequity; 4 governance; and 5 resilience and sustainability. Each theme comprises\nthree-to-five indicator domains. This paper builds on that architecture,\npresenting the inclusive, consultative process used to select indicators and an\napplication of the indicator framework using the latest available data,\nconstructing the first global food systems baseline to track transformation.\nWhile data are available to cover most themes and domains, critical indicator\ngaps exist such as off-farm livelihoods, food loss and waste, and governance.\nBaseline results demonstrate every region or country can claim positive\noutcomes in some parts of food systems, but none are optimal across all\ndomains, and some indicators are independent of national income. These results\nunderscore the need for dedicated monitoring and transformation agendas\nspecific to food systems. Tracking these indicators to 2030 and beyond will\nallow for data-driven food systems governance at all scales and increase\naccountability for urgently needed progress toward achieving global goals.",

        "abstract": "Immigration is often blamed for increasing unemployment among local workers.\nThis sentiment is reflected in the rise of anti-immigration parties and\npolicies in Western democracies. And in fact, numerous studies estimate that in\nthe short run, the arrival of new workers in a labor market raises the\nunemployment rate of local workers. Yet, standard migration models, such as the\nWalrasian model and the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model, inherently assume\nthat immigrants are absorbed into the labor market without affecting local\nunemployment. This paper presents a more general model of migration that allows\nfor the possibility that not only the wages but also the unemployment rate of\nlocal workers may be affected by the arrival of newcomers. This extension is\nessential to capture the full range of potential impacts of labor migration on\nlabor markets. The model blends a matching framework with job rationing. In it,\nthe arrival of new workers raises the unemployment rate among local workers,\nparticularly in a depressed labor market where job opportunities are limited.\nOn the positive side, in-migration helps firms fill vacancies more easily,\nboosting their profits. The overall impact of in-migration on local welfare\nvaries with labor market conditions: in-migration reduces welfare when the\nlabor market is inefficiently slack, but it enhances welfare when the labor\nmarket is inefficiently tight.",

The proposed new approach to such problems was prompted by the\nsurprising discovery that the common strategy, adopted in a large body of\nresearch, for producing time-invariant equilibrium in the classical\nAiyagari-Bewley-Huggett model fails to achieve its objective in a widely cited\nbenchmark study, with the implication that a central problem in macroeconomics\nhas been without an adequate solution, and despite recent advances based on\nnovel mathematical techniques borrowed from the theory of mean field games. It\nis shown that the intrinsic structure of a generic heterogeneous agent\nincomplete market model imposes connections across time that existing\nmathematical frameworks cannot capture. The new technique is shown to provide\nnumerically verifiable equilibria in some widely researched, yet still\nunsolved, concrete instances of heterogeneous agent models. The scope of \"the\napproximate aggregation conjecture\" of Krusell and Smith (still an open problem\nin macroeconomics) is clarified and a new computational strategy, which does\nnot rely on simulation or the need to postulate infinite time horizon, for\nmodels with common shocks is developed.

In our first study, we draw on 42 million ad impressions from\n111 publishers covering EU desktop browsing traffic in 2016. In our second\nstudy, we use 218 million ad impressions from 10,526 publishers (i.e., apps)\ncovering EU and US mobile in-app browsing traffic in 2023. The two studies\ndiffer in the share of trackable users (Study 1: 85%; Study 2: Apple: 17%,\nAndroid: 91%). Still, we find similar average ad impression price decreases\n(Study 1: 18% and Study 2: 23%) when user tracking is unavailable. More than\n90% of the publishers realize lower prices when selling ad impressions for\nuntrackable users. Publishers offering content on sports, cars, lifestyle &\nshopping, and news & information suffer the most. Premium publishers with\nhigh-quality edited content and strong reputations, thematic-focused (niche)\npublishers, and smaller publishers suffer less from the unavailability of user\ntracking. In contrast, non-premium publishers with non-edited or user-generated\ncontent, thematic-broad (general news) publishers, and larger publishers suffer\nmore. The availability of a user ID generates the highest value for publishers,\nwhereas collecting a user's browsing history, perceived as intrusive by most\nusers, generates only a small value for publishers. These results affirm that\nensuring user privacy online has substantial costs for online publishers, but\nthose costs differ across publishers and the type of collected data.

        "title": "Proxy Forecasting to Avoid Stochastic Decision Rules in Decision Markets",
        "abstract": "Information that is of relevance for decision-making is often distributed,\nand held by self-interested agents. Decision markets are well-suited mechanisms\nto elicit such information and aggregate it into conditional forecasts that can\nbe used for decision-making. However, for incentive-compatible elicitation,\ndecision markets rely on stochastic decision rules which entails that sometimes\nactions have to be taken that have been predicted to be sub-optimal. In this\nwork, we propose three closely related mechanisms that elicit and aggregate\ninformation similar to a decision market, but are incentive compatible despite\nusing a deterministic decision rule. Following ideas from peer prediction\nmechanisms, proxies rather than observed future outcomes are used to score\npredictions. The first mechanism requires the principal to have her own signal,\nwhich is then used as a proxy to elicit information from a group of\nself-interested agents. The principal then deterministically maps the\naggregated forecasts and the proxy to the best possible decision. The second\nand third mechanisms expand the first to cover a scenario where the principal\ndoes not have access to her own signal. The principal offers a partial profit\nto align the interest of one agent and retrieve its signal as a proxy; or\nalternatively uses a proper peer prediction mechanism to elicit signals from\ntwo agents. Aggregation and decision-making then follow the first mechanism. We\nevaluate our first mechanism using a multi-agent bandit learning system. The\nresult suggests that the mechanism can train agents to achieve a performance\nsimilar to a Bayesian inference model with access to all information held by\nthe agents.",

Yet, little is known about\nminimum wage effects on wholesale prices and whether retailers face a wholesale\ncost shock in addition to the labor cost shock. I exploit the vertically\ndisintegrated market structure of Washington state's legal recreational\ncannabis industry to investigate minimum wage pass-through to wholesale and\nretail prices. In a difference-in-differences with continuous treatment\nframework, I utilize scanner data on $6 billion of transactions across the\nsupply chain and leverage geographic variation in firms' minimum wage exposure\nacross six minimum wage hikes between 2018 and 2021. When ignoring wholesale\ncost effects, I find retail pass-through elasticities consistent with existing\nliterature -- yet retail pass-through elasticities more than double once\nwholesale cost effects are accounted for. Retail markups do not adjust to the\nwholesale cost shock, indicating a full pass-through of the wholesale cost\nshock to retail prices. The results highlight the importance of analyzing the\nentire supply chain when evaluating the product market effects of minimum wage\nhikes.",

Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based\non their alignment with LLM capabilities, integrating both human expertise and\nGPT-4 classifications. Our findings reveal that around 80% of the U.S.\nworkforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the\nintroduction of LLMs, while approximately 19% of workers may see at least 50%\nof their tasks impacted. We do not make predictions about the development or\nadoption timeline of such LLMs. The projected effects span all wage levels,\nwith higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities\nand LLM-powered software. Significantly, these impacts are not restricted to\nindustries with higher recent productivity growth. Our analysis suggests that,\nwith access to an LLM, about 15% of all worker tasks in the US could be\ncompleted significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating\nsoftware and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to between 47\nand 56% of all tasks.

The obtained\nmacroscopic system indicates that the concentration of the workforce in the\nreal world can be explained through a new type of taxis central to human\nbehavior, highlighting the relevance of urbanization to blow-up phenomena in\nthe derived PDE system. We then characterize the transition between the\naggregation and diffusion regimes both analytically and computationally.

Despite the\nsignificance of these debates, there has been a noticeable absence of any\ncomprehensive cost-benefit analysis. This article fills this gap on the cost\nside by suggesting an approach to estimate the economic consequences of\nlifetime restrictions on cookies for publishers. The empirical study on cookies\nof 54,127 users who received 128 million ad impressions over 2.5 years yields\nan average cookie lifetime of 279 days, with an average value of EUR 2.52 per\ncookie. Only 13% of all cookies increase their daily value over time, but their\naverage value is about four times larger than the average value of all cookies.\nRestricting cookies lifetime to one year (two years) decreases their lifetime\nvalue by 25% (19%), which represents a decrease in the value of all cookies of\n9% (5%). In light of the EUR 10.60 billion cookie-based display ad revenue in\nEurope, such restrictions would endanger EUR 904 million (EUR 576 million)\nannually, equivalent to EUR 2.08 (EUR 1.33) per EU internet user.

The prior techno-economic analyses (TEAs) of\nlunar propellant production had disagreed over this. The \"gear ratio on cost\"\nfor capital transport, G, and the production mass ratio of the capital, phi,\nare identified as the most important factors determining competitiveness. The\nprior TEAs are examined for how they handled these two metrics. This identifies\ncrucial mistakes in some of the TEAs: choosing transportation architectures\nwith high G, and neglecting to make choices for the capital that could achieve\nadequate phi. The tent sublimation technology has a value of phi that is an\norder of magnitude better than the threshold for competitiveness even in low\nEarth orbit (LEO). The strip mining technology is closer to the threshold, but\ntechnological improvements plus several years of operating experience will\nimprove its competitiveness, according to the model.

The expected environmental impact\nof the crowd-shipping delivery was not considered as important by the\ne-shoppers, which is explained by low concerns about the environment and\ncar-oriented mobility in the considered case study.",

        "title": "Main Concepts and Principles of Political Economy -- Production and Values, Distribution and Prices, Reproduction and Profits",
        "abstract": "This book starts from the basic questions that had been raised by the\nfounders of Economic theory, Smith, Ricardo, and Marx: what makes the value of\ncommodities, what are production, exchange, money and incomes like profits,\nwages and rents. The answers that these economists had provided were mostly\nwrong, above all by defining the equivalence of commodities at the level of\nexchange, but also because of a confusion made between values and prices, and\nwrong views of what production really is and the role of fixed capital. Using\nthe mathematical theory of measurement and the physical theory of dimensional\nanalysis, this book provides a coherent theory of value based on an equivalence\nrelation not at the level of exchange, but of production. Indeed exchange is\nconsidered here as an equivalence relation between money and a monetary price,\nand not between commodities, modern monetary theory having demonstrated that\nmoney is not a commodity. The book rejects the conception of production as a\nsurplus, which owes much to Sraffa's theory of production prices, and is shown\nto be severely flawed. It founds the equivalence of commodities at the level of\na production process considered as a transformation process. It rehabilitates\nthe labor theory of value, based on the connection between money and labor due\nthe monetary payment of wages, which allows the homogenization of various kinds\nof concrete labor into abstract labor. It shows that value is then a dimension\nof commodities and that this dimension is time, i.e. the time of physics. On\nthis background, the book shows that the calculation of values for all\ncommodities is always possible, even in the case of joint production, and that\nthere cannot be any commodity residue left by this calculation. As a further\nstep, this book provides a coherent theory of the realization of the product,\nwhich occurs in the circulation process. Using an idea - the widow's cruse -\nintroduced by Keynes in his Treatise on Money, it brings to light the mechanism\nbehind the transformation of money values into money prices and of\nsurplus-value into profits and other transfer incomes, ensuring the formation\nof monetary profits. The book sheds some light on the rate of profit, its\ndeterminants and its evolution, showing in particular the paramount importance\nof capitalist consumption as one of its main determinants. In passing it\nexplains the reasons why in the real world there is a multiplicity of profit\nrates. Finally, it allows to solve in a precise and illustrated way the\nproblems raised by the Marxist law of the tendency of the rate of profit to\nfall. Most of the results obtained translate into principles, the first ones\nbeing truly basic, the following ones less basic, but all of them being\nfundamental. All in all, this book might provide the first building blocks to\ndevelop a full-fledged and scientific economic theory to many fellow\neconomists, critical of neo-classical theory, but who have not yet dicovered\nthe bases of a complete and coherent alternative.",

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with upstreamness and downstreamness of industries\nand countries in global value chains. Upstreamness and downstreamness measure\nrespectively the average distance of an industrial sector from final\nconsumption and from primary inputs, and they are computed from based on the\nmost used global Input-Output tables databases, e.g., the World Input-Output\nDatabase (WIOD). Recently, Antr\\`as and Chor reported a puzzling and\ncounter-intuitive finding in data from the period 1995-2011, namely that (at\ncountry level) upstreamness appears to be positively correlated with\ndownstreamness, with a correlation slope close to $+1$. This effect is stable\nover time and across countries, and it has been confirmed and validated by\nlater analyses. We first analyze a simple model of random Input/Output tables,\nand we show that, under minimal and realistic structural assumptions, there is\na natural positive correlation emerging between upstreamness and downstreamness\nof the same industrial sector/country, with correlation slope equal to $+1$.\nThis effect is robust against changes in the randomness of the entries of the\nI/O table and different aggregation protocols. Secondly, we perform experiments\nby randomly reshuffling the entries of the empirical I/O table where these\npuzzling correlations are detected, in such a way that the global structural\nconstraints are preserved. Again, we find that the upstreamness and\ndownstreamness of the same industrial sector/country are positively correlated\nwith slope close to $+1$, even though the random reshuffling has destroyed any\nunderlying economic information about inter-sectorial connections and trends.\nOur results strongly suggest that the empirically observed puzzling correlation\nmay rather be a necessary consequence of the few structural constraints that\nInput/Output tables must meet.",

These two methods construct different tables\nrepresenting counterfactual joint educational distributions of couples.\nThereby, they disagree on the trend of revealed preferences identified from the\nprevalence of homogamy by counterfactual decompositions. By finding\nself-reported homophily to display a U-shaped pattern, our tests reject the\nhypothesis that the IPF is suitable for constructing counterfactuals in\ngeneral, while we cannot reject the applicability of the NM. The significance\nof our survey-based method-selection is due to the fact that the choice between\nthe IPF and the NM makes a difference not only to the identified historical\ntrend of revealed homophily, but also to what future paths of social inequality\nare believed to be possible.",

Hence, the\ndisproportion of women in female-dominated sectors implies contractual features\nand lower wages typical of that sector, on average, for all workers. This\ndifference is primarily explained by \"persistent discriminatory constraints\",\nwhile human capital-related characteristics play a minor role. However, wage\ndifferentials would shrink if workers had the same potential and residual wages\nas men in male-dominated sectors.

In this paper, I develop a model of importer-exporter\nprocurement where the importer procures international inputs from exporting\nfirms in developing countries. The exporters are credit constrained for working\ncapital, incur the per-shipment fixed costs, and get paid after goods are\ndelivered to the importer. The model shows that the shipping frequency\nincreases for high financing costs in origin and destination. Furthermore,\nlonger delivery times increase shipping frequency as well as procurement costs.\nThe model also shows that the higher per-shipment fixed costs reduce the\nshipping frequency, in line with previous literature. Reduced transaction costs\nlower the exporter's demand for financial services through shipping frequency\nadjustment, mitigating the financial frictions of the firm. Then, I empirically\ninvestigate whether the conclusions regarding the effect of per-shipment fixed\ncosts on shipping frequency from the theoretical model and in the existing\nliterature extend to developing countries. My estimation method addresses\nseveral biases. First, I deal with aggregation bias with the firm, product, and\ncountry-level analysis. Second, I consider the Poisson Pseudo Maximum\nLikelihood (PPML) estimation method to deal with heteroscedasticity bias from\nthe OLS estimation of log-linear models. Third, I fix the distance\nnon-linearity of Bangladeshi exports. Finally, I consider the effect of\nfinancing cost on shipping frequency to address omitted variable bias. Using\ntransaction-level export data from Bangladesh, I find that 10% higher\nper-shipment costs reduce the shipping frequency by 3.45%.

        "abstract": "Classical demand modeling analyzes travel behavior using only low-dimensional\nnumeric data (i.e. sociodemographics and travel attributes) but not\nhigh-dimensional urban imagery. However, travel behavior depends on the factors\nrepresented by both numeric data and urban imagery, thus necessitating a\nsynergetic framework to combine them. This study creates a theoretical\nframework of deep hybrid models with a crossing structure consisting of a\nmixing operator and a behavioral predictor, thus integrating the numeric and\nimagery data into a latent space. Empirically, this framework is applied to\nanalyze travel mode choice using the MyDailyTravel Survey from Chicago as the\nnumeric inputs and the satellite images as the imagery inputs. We found that\ndeep hybrid models outperform both the traditional demand models and the recent\ndeep learning in predicting the aggregate and disaggregate travel behavior with\nour supervision-as-mixing design. The latent space in deep hybrid models can be\ninterpreted, because it reveals meaningful spatial and social patterns. The\ndeep hybrid models can also generate new urban images that do not exist in\nreality and interpret them with economic theory, such as computing substitution\npatterns and social welfare changes. Overall, the deep hybrid models\ndemonstrate the complementarity between the low-dimensional numeric and\nhigh-dimensional imagery data and between the traditional demand modeling and\nrecent deep learning. It generalizes the latent classes and variables in\nclassical hybrid demand models to a latent space, and leverages the\ncomputational power of deep learning for imagery while retaining the economic\ninterpretability on the microeconomics foundation.",

        "abstract": "The vast literature on exchange rate fluctuations estimates the exchange rate\npass-through (ERPT). Most ERPT studies consider annually aggregated data for\ndeveloped or large developing countries for estimating ERPT. These estimates\nvary widely depending on the type of country, data coverage, and frequency.\nHowever, the ERPT estimation using firm-level high-frequency export data of a\nsmall developing country is rare. In this paper, I estimate the pricing to\nmarket and the exchange rate pass-through at a monthly, quarterly, and annual\nlevel of data frequency to deal with aggregation bias. Furthermore, I\ninvestigate how delivery time-based factors such as frequent shipments and\nfaster transport affect a firm`s pricing-to-market behavior. Using\ntransaction-level export data of Bangladesh from 2005 to 2013 and the Poisson\nPseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimation method, I find very small pricing\nto the markets to the exchange rates in the exporter's price. As pass-through\nshows how the exporters respond to macro shocks, for Bangladesh, this low\nexport price response to the exchange rate changes indicates that currency\ndevaluation might not have a significant effect on the exporter. The minimal\nprice response and high pass-through contrast with the literature on incomplete\npass-through at the annual level. By considering the characteristics of the\nfirms, products, and destinations, I investigate the heterogeneity of the\npass-through. The findings remain consistent with several robustness checks.",

Empirically, we exploit two complementary settings\nthat represent plausible exogenous changes in government guarantees: the\nincrease in implicit guarantees following the creation of the Eurozone and the\nremoval of explicit guarantees granted to the Landesbanken. We show that\nincreases (decreases) in government guarantees are associated with significant\ndecreases (increases) in banks' income smoothing. Taken together, our results\nlargely corroborate the predominance of a tail-risk channel, wherein government\nguarantees reduce banks' tail risk, thereby reducing managers' incentives to\nengage in income smoothing.",

        "abstract": "Following the invasion of Ukraine, the US, UK, and EU governments--among\nothers--sanctioned oligarchs close to Putin. This approach has come under\nscrutiny, as evidence has emerged of the oligarchs' successful evasion of these\npunishments. To address this problem, we analyze the role of an overlooked but\nhighly influential group: the secretive professional intermediaries who create\nand administer the oligarchs' offshore financial empires. Drawing on the\nOffshore Leaks Database provided by the International Consortium of\nInvestigative Journalists (ICIJ), we examine the ties linking offshore expert\nadvisors (lawyers, accountants, and other wealth management professionals) to\nultra-high-net-worth individuals from four countries: Russia, China, the United\nStates, and Hong Kong. We find that resulting nation-level \"oligarch networks\"\nshare a scale-free structure characterized by heterogeneity of heavy-tailed\ndegree distributions of wealth managers; however, network topologies diverge\nacross clients from democratic versus autocratic regimes. While generally\nrobust, scale-free networks are fragile when targeted by attacks on\nhighly-connected nodes. Our \"knock-out\" experiments pinpoint this vulnerability\nto the small group of wealth managers themselves, suggesting that sanctioning\nthese professional intermediaries may be more effective and efficient in\ndisrupting dark finance flows than sanctions on their wealthy clients. This\nvulnerability is especially pronounced amongst Russian oligarchs, who\nconcentrate their offshore business in a handful of boutique wealth management\nfirms. The distinctive patterns we identify suggest a new approach to\nsanctions, focused on expert intermediaries to disrupt the finances and\nalliances of their wealthy clients. More generally, our research contributes to\nthe larger body of work on complexity science and the structures of secrecy.",

The constantly\nevolving nature of cyber-threats and lack of public data sharing mean that the\neconomic conditions required for quoted cyber-insurance premiums to be\nconsidered efficient are highly unlikely to be met. This paper develops Monte\nCarlo simulations of an artificial cyber-insurance market and compares the\nefficient and inefficient outcomes based on the informational setup between the\nmarket participants. The existence of diverse loss distributions is justified\nby the dynamic nature of cyber-threats and the absence of any reliable and\ncentralised incident reporting. It is shown that the limited involvement of\nreinsurers when loss expectations are not shared leads to increased premiums\nand lower overall capacity. This suggests that the sustainability of the\ncyber-insurance market requires both better data sharing and external sources\nof risk tolerant capital.",

        "abstract": "Ridesharing platforms are a type of two-sided marketplace where\n``supply-demand balance'' is critical for market efficiency and yet is complex\nto define and analyze. We present a unified analytical framework based on the\ngraph-based equilibrium metric (GEM) for quantifying the supply-demand\nspatiotemporal state and efficiency of a ridesharing marketplace. GEM was\ndeveloped as a generalized Wasserstein distance between the supply and demand\ndistributions in a ridesharing market and has been used as an evaluation metric\nfor algorithms expected to improve supply-demand alignment. Building upon GEM,\nwe develop SD-GEM, a dual-perspective (supply- and demand-side) representation\nof rideshare market equilibrium. We show that there are often disparities\nbetween the two views and examine how this dual-view leads to the notion of\nmarket efficiency, in which we propose novel statistical tests for capturing\nimprovement and explaining the underlying driving factors.",

This broadening of operational scope in a pursuit of revenue\ndiversification may be beneficial if banks exhibit scope economies. The\nexisting (two-decade-old) empirical evidence lends no support for such\nproduct-scope-driven cost economies in banking, but it is greatly outdated and,\nsurprisingly, there has been little (if any) research on this subject despite\nthe drastic transformations that the U.S. banking industry has undergone over\nthe past two decades in the wake of technological advancements and regulatory\nchanges. Commercial banks have significantly shifted towards nontraditional\noperations, making the portfolio of products offered by present-day banks very\ndifferent from that two decades ago. In this paper, we provide new and more\nrobust evidence about scope economies in U.S. commercial banking. We improve\nupon the prior literature not only by analyzing the most recent data and\naccounting for bank's nontraditional off-balance sheet operations, but also in\nmultiple methodological ways. To test for scope economies, we estimate a\nflexible time-varying-coefficient panel-data quantile regression model which\naccommodates three-way heterogeneity across banks. Our results provide strong\nevidence in support of significantly positive scope economies across banks of\nvirtually all sizes.

Our approach is\nnovel in that we explicitly model spatial variation in parameters in the\nproduction-function estimation. We accomplish this by allowing both the\ninput-elasticity and productivity parameters to be unknown functions of the\nfirm's geographic location and estimate them via local kernel methods. This\nallows the production technology to vary across space, thereby accommodating\nneighborhood influences on firm production. In doing so, we are also able to\nexamine the role of cross-location differences in explaining the variation in\noperational productivity among firms. Our model is superior to the alternative\nspatial production-function formulations because it (i) explicitly estimates\nthe cross-locational variation in production functions, (ii) is readily\nreconcilable with the conventional production axioms and, more importantly,\n(iii) can be identified from the data by building on the popular proxy-variable\nmethods, which we extend to incorporate locational heterogeneity.

Whereas, the secondary channel of learning\nvia cross-firm spillovers from exporting peers, or \"learning from exporters,\"\nhas largely been neglected. Omitting this important mechanism, which can\nbenefit both exporters and non-exporters, may provide an incomplete assessment\nof the total productivity benefits of exporting. In this paper, we develop a\nunified empirical framework for productivity measurement that explicitly\naccommodates both channels. To do this, we formalize the evolution of firm\nproductivity as an export-controlled process, allowing future productivity to\nbe affected by both the firm's own export behavior as well as export behavior\nof spatially proximate, same-industry peers. This facilitates a simultaneous,\n\"internally consistent\" identification of firm productivity and the\ncorresponding effects of exporting.

First, a clear behavioral understanding is lacking as to\nthe perceived concern about AV safety and the consequent effect on AV\nacceptance behavior. Second, how people appraise the benefits of enhanced\nautomated mobility to meet their current (pre-AV era) travel behavior and\nneeds, along with the resulting impacts on AV acceptance and perceived safety\nconcern, remain equivocal. To fill these gaps, a recursive trivariate\neconometric model with ordinal-continuous outcomes is employed, which jointly\nestimates AV acceptance (ordinal), perceived AV safety concern (ordinal), and\ncurrent annual vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) approximating the current travel\nbehavior (continuous). Importantly, the co-estimation of the three endogenous\noutcomes allows to capture the true interdependencies among them, net of any\ncorrelated unobserved factors that can have common impacts on these outcomes.\nBesides the classical socio-economic characteristics, the outcome variables are\nfurther explained by the latent preferences for vehicle attributes (including\nvehicle cost, reliability, performance, and refueling) and for existing shared\nmobility systems. The model estimation results on a stated preference survey in\nthe State of California provide insights into proactive policies that can\npopularize AVs through gearing towards the most affected population groups,\nparticularly vehicle cost-conscious, safety-concerned, and lower-VMT (such as\ntravel-restrictive) individuals.",

        "abstract": "Calibrating agent-based models (ABMs) in economics and finance typically\ninvolves a derivative-free search in a very large parameter space. In this\nwork, we benchmark a number of search methods in the calibration of a\nwell-known macroeconomic ABM on real data, and further assess the performance\nof \"mixed strategies\" made by combining different methods. We find that methods\nbased on random-forest surrogates are particularly efficient, and that\ncombining search methods generally increases performance since the biases of\nany single method are mitigated. Moving from these observations, we propose a\nreinforcement learning (RL) scheme to automatically select and combine search\nmethods on-the-fly during a calibration run. The RL agent keeps exploiting a\nspecific method only as long as this keeps performing well, but explores new\nstrategies when the specific method reaches a performance plateau. The\nresulting RL search scheme outperforms any other method or method combination\ntested, and does not rely on any prior information or trial and error\nprocedure.",

Using our estimated model, we show that the optimal\nsecond-degree price discrimination (i.e., optimal nonlinear tariff) improves\nthe firm's profit upon linear pricing by at least 8.2%. That said, this\nsecond-degree price discrimination scheme only recovers 7.1% of the gap between\nthe profitability of linear pricing and that of infeasible first degree price\ndiscrimination.

However, economic growth,\nrobustness, and resilience crucially depend on the detailed structure of\nnon-aggregated firm-level production networks (FPNs). Due to non-availability\nof data little is known about how much aggregated sector-based and detailed\nfirm-level-based model-predictions differ. Using a nearly complete nationwide\nFPN, containing 243,399 Hungarian firms with 1,104,141 supplier-buyer-relations\nwe self-consistently compare production losses on the aggregated industry-level\nproduction network (IPN) and the granular FPN. For this we model the\npropagation of shocks of the same size on both, the IPN and FPN, where the\nlatter captures relevant heterogeneities within industries. In a COVID-19\ninspired scenario we model the shock based on detailed firm-level data during\nthe early pandemic. We find that using IPNs instead of FPNs leads to errors up\nto 37% in the estimation of economic losses, demonstrating a natural limitation\nof industry-level IO-models in predicting economic outcomes. We ascribe the\nlarge discrepancy to the significant heterogeneity of firms within industries:\nwe find that firms within one sector only sell 23.5% to and buy 19.3% from the\nsame industries on average, emphasizing the strong limitations of industrial\nsectors for representing the firms they include. Similar error-levels are\nexpected when estimating economic growth, CO2 emissions, and the impact of\npolicy interventions with industry-level IO models.

For given\nparameterizations, we determine the theoretically optimal spending strategies\nby numerically computing Nash equilibria. Using this approach we find that (1)\nin symmetric scenarios, compute price increases are safety-promoting if and\nonly if the production of performance scales faster than the production of\nsafety; (2) the probability of a disaster can be made arbitrarily low by\nproviding a sufficiently large subsidy to a single agent; (3) when agents\ndiffer in productivity, providing a subsidy to the more productive agent is\noften better for aggregate safety than providing the same subsidy to other\nagent(s) (with some qualifications, which we discuss); (4) when one agent is\nmuch more safety-conscious, in the sense of believing that safety is more\ndifficult to achieve, relative to his competitors, subsidizing that agent is\ntypically better for aggregate safety than subsidizing its competitors;\nhowever, subsidizing an agent that is only somewhat more safety-conscious often\ndecreases safety.

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the role of a transmission system operator within a\ncarbon footprint reduction strategy incorporating carbon taxes and renewable\nenergy generation subsidies in the decentralised energy market. This is\nachieved via an optimisation bi-level model in which a welfare-maximizing\ntransmission system operator makes investments in transmission lines at the\nupper level while considering power market dynamics at the lower level. To\naccount for the deregulated energy market structure, this paper assumes that\nthe generation companies at the lower level make capacity investments as\nprice-takers in perfect competition. Considering alternative transmission\ninfrastructure expansion budgets, carbon emission taxes and monetary incentives\nfor renewable energy generation capacity expansion, the impact of alternative\ncompositions of these factors is analysed against three output factors: the\nshare of renewable energy in the generation mix, total generation amount, and\nsocial welfare. The proposed modelling assessment is applied to an illustrative\nthree-node instance and a case study considering a simplified representation of\nthe energy system of the Nordic and Baltic countries. The results highlight\nthat, under certain circumstances, renewable energy generation subsidies may\nlead to an increase of renewable energy in the generation mix followed by a\nsimultaneous fall in the total generation amount. Nevertheless, when applied\ntogether, these three measures demonstrated a positive impact on all output\nfactors within Nordics' and Baltics' energy systems. The experiments\nadditionally suggest that considering the high value of the carbon tax does not\nhave an impact on the output factors while the composition of high values of\nrenewable energy generation subsidies and budget for transmission\ninfrastructure expansion has the strongest effect.",

Second, the\nstability of upside risks to GDP growth reported in earlier research is\nspecific to the period known as the Great Moderation, with the distribution of\nrisks being more balanced before the 1970s. Third, the distribution of GDP\ngrowth has significantly narrowed since the end of the Bretton Woods system.\nFourth, financial stress is always linked to higher downside risks, but it does\nnot affect upside risks. Finally, other risk indicators, such as credit growth\nand house prices, not only drive downside risks, but also contribute to\nincreased upside risks during boom periods. In this context, the paper also\nadds to the financial cycle literature by completing the picture of drivers\n(and risks) for both booms and recessions over time.",

        "abstract": "In the thirty years since the end of real socialism, Bulgaria's went from\nhaving a rather radically 'different' tax system to adopting flat-rate taxation\nwith marginal tax rates that fell from figures as high as 40% to 10% for both\nthe corporate-income tax and the personal-income tax. Crucially, the\neconometric forecasting models in use at the Bulgarian Ministry of Finance\nhinted at an increase in tax revenue compatible with the so-called 'Laffer\ncurve'. Similarly, many economists held the view that revenues would have\nincreased. However, reality fell short of those expectations based on\nforecasting models and rooted in mainstream economic theory. Thus, this paper\nasks whether there are betterperforming forecasting models for personal-and\ncorporate-income tax-revenues in Bulgaria that are readily implementable and\noverperform the ones currently in use. After articulating a constructive\ncritique of the current forecasting models, the paper offers readily\nimplementable, transparent alternatives and proves their superiority.",

The probability of\nsuccess of startups has been shown to relate to several firm-level factors such\nas industry, location and the economy of the day. Still, attention has\nincreasingly considered internal factors relating to the firm's founding team,\nincluding their previous experiences and failures, their centrality in a global\nnetwork of other founders and investors as well as the team's size. The effects\nof founders' personalities on the success of new ventures are mainly unknown.\nHere we show that founder personality traits are a significant feature of a\nfirm's ultimate success. We draw upon detailed data about the success of a\nlarge-scale global sample of startups. We found that the Big 5 personality\ntraits of startup founders across 30 dimensions significantly differed from\nthat of the population at large. Key personality facets that distinguish\nsuccessful entrepreneurs include a preference for variety, novelty and starting\nnew things (openness to adventure), like being the centre of attention (lower\nlevels of modesty) and being exuberant (higher activity levels). However, we do\nnot find one \"Founder-type\" personality; instead, six different personality\ntypes appear, with startups founded by a \"Hipster, Hacker and Hustler\" being\ntwice as likely to succeed. Our results also demonstrate the benefits of\nlarger, personality-diverse teams in startups, which has the potential to be\nextended through further research into other team settings within business,\ngovernment and research.",

In particular, the\nfocus is on noisy large-scale problems, which often involve a multitude of\ndimensions as well as multiple local optima. Our aim is to combine the property\nof multi-armed bandits to cope with volatile simulation observations with the\nability of genetic algorithms to handle high-dimensional solution spaces\naccompanied by an enormous number of feasible solutions. For this purpose, a\nmulti-armed bandit framework serves as a foundation, where each observed\nsimulation is incorporated into the memory of GMAB. Based on this memory,\ngenetic operators guide the search, as they provide powerful tools for\nexploration as well as exploitation. The empirical results demonstrate that\nGMAB achieves superior performance compared to benchmark algorithms from the\nliterature in a large variety of test problems. In all experiments, GMAB\nrequired considerably fewer simulations to achieve similar or (far) better\nsolutions than those generated by existing methods. At the same time, GMAB's\noverhead with regard to the required runtime is extremely small due to the\nsuggested tree-based implementation of its memory. Furthermore, we prove its\nconvergence to the set of global optima as the simulation effort goes to\ninfinity.",

In the linear\nmethod, this paper uses an OLS regression model to find more accurate\ncoefficients within the same Taylor Rule equation in which the dependent\nvariable is the federal funds rate, and the independent variables are the\ninflation rate, the inflation gap, and the output gap. The intercept in the OLS\nregression model would capture the constant equilibrium target real interest\nrate set at 2. The linear OLS method suggests that the Taylor Rule\noverestimates the output gap and standalone inflation rate's coefficients for\nthe Taylor Rule. The coefficients this paper suggests are shown in equation\n(2). In the nonlinear method, this paper uses a machine learning system in\nwhich the two inputs are the inflation rate and the output gap and the output\nis the federal funds rate. This system utilizes gradient descent error\nminimization to create a model that minimizes the error between the estimated\nfederal funds rate and the actual previously implemented federal funds rate.\nSince the machine learning system allows the model to capture the more\nrealistic nonlinear relationship between the variables, it significantly\nincreases the estimation accuracy as a result. The actual and estimated federal\nfunds rates are almost identical besides three recessions caused by bubble\nbursts, which the paper addresses in the concluding remarks. Overall, the first\nmethod provides theoretical insight while the second suggests a model with\nimproved applicability.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a class of investment project's profitability metrics\nthat includes the net present value (NPV) criterion (which labels a project as\nweakly profitable if its NPV is nonnegative), internal rate of return (IRR),\nprofitability index (PI), payback period (PP), and discounted payback period\n(DPP) as special cases. We develop an axiomatic characterization of this class,\nas well as of the mentioned conventional metrics within the class. The proposed\napproach offers several key contributions. First, it provides a unified\ninterpretation of profitability metrics as indicators of a project's financial\nstability across various economic scenarios. Second, it reveals that, except\nfor the NPV criterion, a profitability metric is inherently undefined for some\nprojects. In particular, this implies that any extension of IRR to the space of\nall projects does not meet a set of reasonable conditions. A similar conclusion\nis valid for the other mentioned conventional metrics. For each of these\nmetrics, we offer a characterization of the pairs of comparable projects and\nidentify the largest set of projects to which the metric can be unequivocally\nextended. Third, our study identifies conditions under which the application of\none metric is superior to others, helping to guide decision-makers in selecting\nthe most appropriate metric for specific investment contexts.",

We study product coreness using firm-product level data\nbetween 2018 and 2020 for Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Three main findings\nemerge from our analysis. First, the composition of firms' export baskets\nchanges relatively little from one year to the other, and products far from the\nfirm's core competencies, with low coreness, are more likely to be dropped.\nSecond, higher coreness is associated with larger export flows at the firm\nlevel. Third, such firm-level patterns also have implications at the aggregate\nlevel: products that are, on average, exported with higher coreness have higher\nexport flows at the country level, which holds across all levels of product\ncomplexity. Therefore, the paper shows that how closely a product fits within a\nfirm's capabilities is important for economic performance at both the firm and\ncountry level. We explore these issues within an econometric framework, finding\nrobust evidence both across our three countries and for each country\nseparately.",

In this work, we conduct a theoretical study to address all these\nissues while still achieving bounded regret.

However, the transfer pricing problem has\nbeen developed in the context where managers are fully individual rational\nutility maximizers. The underlying assumptions are rather heroic and, in\nparticular, how managers process information under uncertainty, do not\nperfectly match with human decision-making behavior. Therefore, this paper\nrelaxes key assumptions and studies whether cognitively bounded agents achieve\nthe same results as fully rational utility maximizers and, in particular,\nwhether the recommendations on managerial-compensation arrangements and\nbargaining infrastructures are designed to maximize headquarters' profit in\nsuch a setting. Based on an agent-based simulation with fuzzy Q-learning\nagents, it is shown that in case of symmetric marginal cost parameters, myopic\nfuzzy Q-learning agents invest only as much as in the classic hold-up problem,\nwhile non-myopic fuzzy Q-learning agents invest optimally. However, in\nscenarios with non-symmetric marginal cost parameters, a deviation from the\npreviously recommended surplus sharing rules can lead to higher investment\ndecisions and, thus, to an increase in the firm's overall profit.",

If this form of informational diversity\nconfers performance advantages, why do we often see largely homogeneous teams\nin practice? One canonical argument is that the benefits of informational\ndiversity are in tension with affinity bias. To better understand the impact of\nthis tension on the makeup of teams, we analyze a sequential model of team\nformation in which individuals care about their team's performance (captured in\nterms of accurately predicting some future outcome based on a set of features)\nbut experience a cost as a result of interacting with teammates who use\ndifferent approaches to the prediction task. Our analysis of this simple model\nreveals a set of subtle behaviors that team-growth dynamics can exhibit: (i)\nfrom certain initial team compositions, they can make progress toward better\nperformance but then get stuck partway to optimally diverse teams; while (ii)\nfrom other initial compositions, they can also move away from this optimal\nbalance as the majority group tries to crowd out the opinions of the minority.\nThe initial composition of the team can determine whether the dynamics will\nmove toward or away from performance optimality, painting a path-dependent\npicture of inefficiencies in team compositions. Our results formalize a\nfundamental limitation of utility-based motivations to drive informational\ndiversity in organizations and hint at interventions that may improve\ninformational diversity and performance simultaneously.",

This study estimates the effects of\ntemperature on worker health using records spanning 1985-2020 from an\nAustralian mandatory insurance scheme. High temperatures are found to cause\nsignificantly more claims, particularly among manual workers in outdoor-based\nindustries. These adverse effects have not diminished across time, with the\nlargest effect observed for the 2015-2020 period, indicating increasing\nvulnerability to heat. Within occupations, the workers most adversely affected\nby heat are female, older-aged and higher-earning. Finally, results from\nfirm-level panel analyses show that the percentage increase in claims on hot\ndays is largest at \"safer\" firms.",

In Japan, hand-washing education in primary schools\nwas positively correlated with preventive behaviours against COVID-19\ntransmission for adults in 2020 during the early stages of COVID-19 [1]. The\nfollowing year, the Tokyo Olympics were held in Japan, and a state of emergency\nwas declared several times. Public perceptions of and risks associated with the\npandemic changed drastically with the emergence of COVID-19 vaccines. We\nre-examine whether effect of hand-washing education on preventive behaviours\npersisted by covering a longer period of the COVID-19 pandemic than previous\nstudies. 26 surveys were conducted nearly once a month for 30 months from March\n2020 (the early stage of COVID-19) to September 2022 in Japan. By corresponding\nwith the same individuals across surveys, we comprehensively gathered data on\npreventive behaviours during this period. In addition, we asked about\nhand-washing education they had received in their primary school. We used the\ndata to investigate how and the degree to which school education is associated\nwith pandemic mitigating preventive behaviours. We found that hand-washing\neducation in primary school is positively associated with behaviours such as\nhand washing and mask wearing as a COVID-19 preventive measure, but not related\nto staying at home. We observed a statistically significant difference in hand\nwashing between adults who received childhood hand-washing education and those\nwho did not. This difference persisted throughout the study period. In\ncomparison, the difference in mask wearing between the two groups was smaller,\nbut still statistically significant. Furthermore, there was no difference in\nstaying at home between them.",

With that and perfect\ncredibility, the theory of the price level and inflation only needs the Fisher\nequation, but it interprets causality in a new sense: if the monetary authority\nraises the policy rate, it will raise the inflation target, and vice versa,\ngiven the natural interest rate. If credibility is not perfect or if\nexpectations are not completely rational, the theory needs something more. Here\nI present a model corresponding to this theory that includes both the steady\nstate case and the recovery dynamics after a supply shock, with and without\npolicy reactions to such a shock. But, under the finite horizon assumption for\nIRT, at some future point in time the money supply must become exogenous. This\ncreates the incentive for agents to examine, as of today, statistics on\nmonetary aggregates and form their forecasts of money supply growth and\ninflation rates. Additionally, inflation models of the small open economy allow\nus to deduce that the IRT in this case is much more powerful than otherwise,\nand for the same degree of credibility. But things are not necessarily easier\nfor the monetary authority: it must monitor not only internal indicators, but\nalso external inflation and its determinants, and it must, in certain\ncircumstances, make more intense adjustments to the interest rate.",

In contrast to the stylized centralized\nplatform, the decentralized platform is powered by blockchain technology, which\nallows for secure and transparent Peer-to-Peer transactions among users.\nTraditional single-chain-based blockchains suffer from the well-known\nblockchain trilemma. Beyond the single-chain-based scheme, decentralized\nhigh-throughput blockchains adopt parallel protocols to reconcile the\nblockchain trilemma, implementing any tasking and desired allocation. However,\nunneglectable network latency may induce partial observability, resulting in\nincoordination and misallocation issues for the decentralized transaction\npackaging process at the current high-throughput blockchain protocols.\n  To address this problem, we consider a strategic coordination mechanism for\nthe decentralized transaction packaging process by using a game-theoretic\napproach. Under a tractable two-period model, we find a Bayesian Nash\nequilibrium of the miner's strategic transaction packaging under partial\nobservability. Along with novel algorithms for computing equilibrium payoffs,\nwe show that the decentralized platform can achieve an efficient and stable\nmarket outcome. The model also highlights that the proposed mechanism can\nendogenously offer a base fee per gas without any restructuration of the\ninitial blockchain transaction fee mechanism.

Aggregate insurance liability cashflows typically\ncorrespond to stochastic payments several years into the future. However,\ninsurance regulation requires that capital requirements are computed for a\none-year horizon, by considering cashflows during the year and end-of-year\nliability values. This implies that liability values must be computed\nrecursively, backwards in time, starting from the year of the most distant\nliability payments. Solving such backward recursions with paper and pen is\nrarely possible, and numerical solutions give rise to major computational\nchallenges.\n  The aim of this paper is to provide explicit and easily computable\nexpressions for multi-period valuations that appear as limit objects for a\nsequence of multi-period models that converge in terms of conditional weak\nconvergence. Such convergence appears naturally if we consider large insurance\nportfolios such that the liability cashflows, appropriately centered and\nscaled, converge weakly as the size of the portfolio tends to infinity.",

Here we develop a novel model that emerges LFNs from agent-level\nbehaviour, removing the necessity of assuming that future job-to-job flows will\nbe along the same paths where they have been historically observed. This model,\ninformed by microdata for the United Kingdom, generates empirical LFNs with a\nhigh level of accuracy. We use the model to explore how shocks impacting the\nunderlying distributions of jobs and wages alter the topology of the LFN.

As the foundational axiom of social mechanisms,\nfairness consists of multiple facets. Although the machine learning (ML)\ncommunity has focused on intersectionality as a matter of statistical parity,\nespecially in discrimination issues, an emerging body of literature addresses\nanother facet -- monotonicity. Based on domain expertise, monotonicity plays a\nvital role in numerous fairness-related areas, where violations could misguide\nhuman decisions and lead to disastrous consequences. In this paper, we first\nsystematically evaluate the significance of applying monotonic neural additive\nmodels (MNAMs), which use a fairness-aware ML algorithm to enforce both\nindividual and pairwise monotonicity principles, for the fairness of AI ethics\nand society. We have found, through a hybrid method of theoretical reasoning,\nsimulation, and extensive empirical analysis, that considering monotonicity\naxioms is essential in all areas of fairness, including criminology, education,\nhealth care, and finance. Our research contributes to the interdisciplinary\nresearch at the interface of AI ethics, explainable AI (XAI), and\nhuman-computer interactions (HCIs).

To this end, we consider a multimodal\ntransportation network, where a ride-hailing platform operates a fleet of AVs\nto offer mobility-on-demand services in competition with a public transit\nagency that offers transit services on a transportation network. A\ngame-theoretic model is developed to characterize the intimate interactions\nbetween the ride-hailing platform, the transit agency, and multiclass\npassengers with distinct income levels. An algorithm is proposed to compute the\nNash equilibrium of the game and conduct an ex-post evaluation of the\nperformance of the obtained solution. Based on the proposed framework, we\nevaluate the spatial and social equity in transport accessibility using the\nTheil index, and find that although the proliferation of for-hire AVs in the\nride-hailing network improves overall accessibility, the benefits are not\nfairly distributed among distinct locations or population groups, implying that\nthe deployment of AVs will enlarge the existing spatial and social inequity\ngaps in the transportation network if no regulatory intervention is in place.\nTo address this concern, we investigate two regulatory policies that can\nimprove transport equity: (a) a minimum service-level requirement on\nride-hailing services, which improves the spatial equity in the transport\nnetwork; (b) a subsidy on transit services by taxing ride-hailing services,\nwhich promotes the use of public transit and improves the spatial and social\nequity of the transport network. We show that the minimum service-level\nrequirement entails a trade-off: as a higher minimum service level is imposed,\nthe spatial inequity reduces, but the social inequity will be exacerbated.

Using an unvaccinated sample\nof UK residents before vaccines were made widely available (N=526), we\ndemonstrate that the individual-focused message significantly reduces overall\nvaccine skepticism, and that this effect is more robust for individuals with a\nlow BJW, whereas the community-focused message does not.

        "abstract": "The subject of this study is inflation, a problem that has plagued America\nand the world over the last several decades. Despite a rich trove of scholarly\nstudies and a wide range of tools developed to deal with inflation, we are\nnowhere near a solution of this problem. We are now in the middle of the\ninflation that threatens to become a stagflation or even a full recession; and\nwe have no idea what to prevent this outcome. This investigation explores the\nreal source of inflation. Tracing the problem of inflation to production, it\nfinds that inflation is not a phenomenon intrinsic to economy; rather, it is a\nresult of inefficiencies and waste in our economy. The investigation leads to a\nconclusion that the solution of the problem of inflation is in achieving full\nefficiency in production. Our economic production is a result of the evolution\nthat is propelled by the process of creation. In order to end economic\ninefficiencies, we should model our economic practice on the process that\npreceded production and has led to its emergence. In addition, the study will\noutline ways in which our economic theory and practice must be changed to\nachieve full efficiency of our production. Finally, the study provides a\ncritical overview of the current theories of inflation and remedies that are\nproposed to deal with it.",

        "abstract": "Health wearables in combination with gamification enable interventions that\nhave the potential to increase physical activity -- a key determinant of\nhealth. However, the extant literature does not provide conclusive evidence on\nthe benefits of gamification, and there are persistent concerns that\ncompetition-based gamification approaches will only benefit those who are\nhighly active at the expense of those who are sedentary. We investigate the\neffect of Fitbit leaderboards on the number of steps taken by the user. Using a\nunique data set of Fitbit wearable users, some of whom participate in a\nleaderboard, we find that leaderboards lead to a 370 (3.5%) step increase in\nthe users' daily physical activity. However, we find that the benefits of\nleaderboards are highly heterogeneous. Surprisingly, we find that those who\nwere highly active prior to adoption are hurt by leaderboards and walk 630\nfewer steps daily after adoption (a 5% relative decrease). In contrast, those\nwho were sedentary prior to adoption benefited substantially from leaderboards\nand walked an additional 1,300 steps daily after adoption (a 15% relative\nincrease). We find that these effects emerge because sedentary individuals\nbenefit even when leaderboards are small and when they do not rank first on\nthem. In contrast, highly active individuals are harmed by smaller leaderboards\nand only see benefit when they rank highly on large leaderboards. We posit that\nthis unexpected divergence in effects could be due to the underappreciated\npotential of noncompetition dynamics (e.g., changes in expectations for\nexercise) to benefit sedentary users, but harm more active ones.",

        "abstract": "Climate change is a non-uniform phenomenon. This paper proposes a new\nquantitative methodology to characterize, measure, and test the existence of\nclimate change heterogeneity. It consists of three steps. First, we introduce a\nnew testable warming typology based on the evolution of the trend of the whole\ntemperature distribution and not only on the average. Second, we define the\nconcepts of warming acceleration and warming amplification in a testable\nformat. And third, we introduce the new testable concept of warming dominance\nto determine whether region A is suffering a worse warming process than region\nB. Applying this three-step methodology, we find that Spain and the Globe\nexperience a clear distributional warming process (beyond the standard average)\nbut of different types. In both cases, this process is accelerating over time\nand asymmetrically amplified. Overall, warming in Spain dominates the Globe in\nall the quantiles except the lower tail of the global temperature distribution\nthat corresponds to the Arctic region. Our climate change heterogeneity results\nopen the door to the need for a non-uniform causal-effect climate analysis that\ngoes beyond the standard causality in mean as well as for a more efficient\ndesign of the mitigation-adaptation policies. In particular, the heterogeneity\nwe find suggests that these policies should contain a common global component\nand a clear local-regional element. Future climate agreements should take the\nwhole temperature distribution into account.",

However, a lack of data on this variable has limited researchers'\nability to understand its role for success in college and the labor market.\nThis paper uses college-admission-exam records from 15 million Brazilian high\nschool students to measure cognitive endurance based on changes in performance\nthroughout the exam. By exploiting exogenous variation in the order of exam\nquestions, I show that students are 7.1 percentage points more likely to\ncorrectly answer a given question when it appears at the beginning of the day\nversus the end (relative to a sample mean of 34.3%). I develop a method to\ndecompose test scores into fatigue-adjusted ability and cognitive endurance. I\nthen merge these measures into a higher-education census and the earnings\nrecords of the universe of Brazilian formal-sector workers to quantify the\nassociation between endurance and long-run outcomes. I find that cognitive\nendurance has a statistically and economically significant wage return.\nControlling for fatigue-adjusted ability and other student characteristics, a\none-standard-deviation higher endurance predicts a 5.4% wage increase. This\nwage return to endurance is sizable, equivalent to a third of the wage return\nto ability. I also document positive associations between endurance and college\nattendance, college quality, college graduation, firm quality, and other\noutcomes. Finally, I show how systematic differences in endurance across\nstudents interact with the exam design to determine the sorting of students to\ncolleges. I discuss the implications of these findings for the use of cognitive\nassessments for talent selection and investments in interventions that build\ncognitive endurance.",

In this paper, I evaluate the\neconomic effects of the peace agreement between the Colombian government and\nthe largest guerrilla group in the country, the FARC, putting an end to one of\nthe longest and most violent armed conflicts in recent history. Using a\ndifference-in-difference strategy comparing municipalities that historically\nhad FARC presence and those with presence of a similar, smaller guerrilla\ngroup, the ELN, before and after the start of a unilateral ceasefire by the\nFARC, I establish three sets of results. First, violence indicators\nsignificantly and sizably decreased in historically FARC municipalities.\nSecond, despite this large reduction in violence, I find precisely-estimated\nnull effects across a variety of economic indicators, suggesting no effect of\nthe peace agreement on economic activity. Furthermore, I use a sharp\ndiscontinuity in eligibility to the government's flagship business and job\ncreation program for conflict-affected areas to evaluate the policy's impact,\nalso finding precisely-estimated null effects on the same economic indicators.\nThird, I present evidence that suggests the reason why historically FARC\nmunicipalities could not reap the economic benefits from the reduction in\nviolence is a lack of state capacity, caused both by their low initial levels\nof state capacity and the lack of state entry post-ceasefire. These results\nindicate that peace agreements require complementary investments in state\ncapacity to yield an economic dividend.",

The central question that arises in this context is: How can\nbottom-up task allocation be guided towards an effective organizational\nstructure? To address this question, this paper presents a novel agent-based\nmodel of an organization that features bottom-up task allocation that can be\nmotivated by either long-term or short-term orientation on the agents' side.\nThe model also includes an incentive mechanism to guide the bottom-up task\nallocation process and create incentives that range from altruistic to\nindividualistic. Our analysis shows that when bottom-up task allocation is\ndriven by short-term orientation and aligned with the incentive mechanisms, it\nleads to improved organizational performance that surpasses that of\ntraditionally designed organizations. Additionally, we find that the presence\nof altruistic incentive mechanisms within the organization reduces the\nimportance of mirroring in task allocation.",

To analyze the data,\nmixed logit models capturing taste heterogeneity as well as flexible\nsubstitution patterns have been estimated.

Associations between\nusers' preferences and socio-demographic characteristics, such as age, gender,\nteleworking frequency and the presence of a delivery box, were also suggested.\nMoreover, we analyzed two willingness-to-pay measures for delivery, namely, the\nvalue of delivery time savings (VODT) and the value of time slot shortening\n(VOTS), and applied a non-semiparametric approach to estimate their\ndistributions in a data-oriented manner. Although VODT has a large\nheterogeneity among respondents, the estimated median VODT is 25.6 JPY/day,\nimplying that more than half of the respondents would wait an additional day if\nthe delivery fee were increased by only 26 JPY, that is, they do not\nnecessarily need a fast delivery option but often request it when cheap or\nalmost free. Moreover, VOTS was found to be low, distributed with the median of\n5.0 JPY/hour; that is, users do not highly value the reduction in time slot\nsize in monetary terms. These findings on e-commerce users' preferences can\nhelp in designing levels of service for last-mile delivery to significantly\nimprove its efficiency.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this research is to get a better understanding of the future of\nlarge-scale 3D printing. By developing the market analysis, it will be clear\nwhether large-scale 3D printing is becoming more of a preferred way of printing\ncustom-made parts for production companies. Companies can then choose whether\nto change their ways, for a more profitable less costly method, or stay on the\nroute they are on. By getting deep into this topic, a new world of technology\nis then being discovered and familiarized. With a mix of theoretical and\npractical relevance, a complete coverage could be made on large-scale 3D\nprinting. This paper could then cover all aspects of this topic, and the reader\ncould then make their own judgment if large-scale 3D printing would be the best\noption.",

        "abstract": "Since supplanting Canada in 2014, Chinese investors have been the lead\nforeign buyers of U.S. real estate, concentrating their purchases in urban\nareas with higher Chinese populations like California. The reasons for\ninvestment include prestige, freedom from capital confiscation, and safe,\ndiversified opportunities from abroad simply being more lucrative and available\nthan in their home country, where the market is eroding. Interestingly, since\n2019, Chinese investors have sold a net 23.6 billion dollars of U.S. commercial\nreal estate, a stark contrast to past acquisitions between 2013 to 2018 where\nthey were net buyers of almost 52 billion dollars worth of properties. A\nsimilar trend appears in the residential real estate segment too. In both 2017\nand 2018, Chinese buyers purchased over 40,000 U.S. residential properties\nwhich were halved in 2019 and steadily declined to only 6,700 in the past year.\nThis turnaround in Chinese investment can be attributed to a deteriorating\nrelationship between the U.S. and China during the Trump Presidency, financial\ndistress in China, and new Chinese government regulations prohibiting outbound\ninvestments. Additionally, while Chinese investment is a small share of U.S.\nreal estate (~1.5% at its peak), it has outsized impacts on market valuations\nof home prices in U.S. zip codes with higher populations of foreign-born\nChinese, increasing property prices and exacerbating the issue of housing\naffordability in these areas. This paper investigates the rapid growth and\ndecline of Chinese investment in U.S. real estate and its effect on U.S. home\nprices in certain demographics.",

        "abstract": "Scientists and philosophers have debated whether humans can trust advanced\nartificial intelligence (AI) agents to respect humanity's best interests. Yet\nwhat about the reverse? Will advanced AI agents trust humans? Gauging an AI\nagent's trust in humans is challenging because--absent costs for\ndishonesty--such agents might respond falsely about their trust in humans. Here\nwe present a method for incentivizing machine decisions without altering an AI\nagent's underlying algorithms or goal orientation. In two separate experiments,\nwe then employ this method in hundreds of trust games between an AI agent (a\nLarge Language Model (LLM) from OpenAI) and a human experimenter (author TJ).\nIn our first experiment, we find that the AI agent decides to trust humans at\nhigher rates when facing actual incentives than when making hypothetical\ndecisions. Our second experiment replicates and extends these findings by\nautomating game play and by homogenizing question wording. We again observe\nhigher rates of trust when the AI agent faces real incentives. Across both\nexperiments, the AI agent's trust decisions appear unrelated to the magnitude\nof stakes. Furthermore, to address the possibility that the AI agent's trust\ndecisions reflect a preference for uncertainty, the experiments include two\nconditions that present the AI agent with a non-social decision task that\nprovides the opportunity to choose a certain or uncertain option; in those\nconditions, the AI agent consistently chooses the certain option. Our\nexperiments suggest that one of the most advanced AI language models to date\nalters its social behavior in response to incentives and displays behavior\nconsistent with trust toward a human interlocutor when incentivized.",

This key question simply boils down to observing\nindividual status and how it moves between two thresholds: the current income\nand the desired income. Yet, our knowledge of these temporal properties of\nincome remains limited since we rely on estimates coming from transition\nmatrices which simplify income dynamics by aggregating the individual changes\ninto quantiles and thus overlooking significant microscopic variations. Here,\nwe bridge this gap by employing First Passage Time concepts in a baseline\nstochastic process with resetting used for modeling income dynamics and\ndeveloping a framework that is able to crucially disaggregate the temporal\nproperties of income to the level of an individual worker. We find analytically\nand illustrate numerically that our framework is orthogonal to the transition\nmatrix approach and leads to improved and more granular estimates. Moreover, to\nfacilitate empirical applications of the framework, we introduce a publicly\navailable statistical methodology, and showcase the application using the USA\nincome dynamics data.

The purpose of this study is\nto identify the impact of cultural factors on the innovation development for\ndifferent income groups during the pre- and post-crisis period. We found that,\nin general, the same cultural properties were required for countries to enhance\ninnovation inputs and outputs regardless of pre- and post-crisis periods and\ntime variances. The significant cultural factors (driving forces) of the\ninnovation performance do not change over time. However, our empirical results\nrevealed that not the crisis itself but the income group (either developed or\ndeveloping) is the factor that influences the relationship between cultural\nproperties and innovation. It is also worth noting that cultural properties\nhave lost much of their impact on innovation, particularly in developing\ncountries, during recent periods. It is highly likely that in terms of\ninnovation, no cultural development or change can significantly impact the\ninnovation output of developing countries without the construction of the\nappropriate systems.",

It is essential for universities to measure\ntheir sustainability performance to capitalise on their core strengths and to\novercome their weaknesses. In line with the stakeholder theory, the objective\nof this study was to investigate students perceptions of university\nsustainability including their expectations about and satisfaction with the\nefforts that universities make towards sustainability. This paper proposes a\nnew approach that combines the sustainable university scale, developed by the\nauthors, with the importance-performance analysis to identify key areas of\nuniversity sustainability. To collect data, an online survey was conducted in\nHungary in 2019. The sustainable university scale was found to be a reliable\nconstruct to measure different aspects of university sustainability. Results of\nthe importance-performance analysis suggest that students consider Hungarian\nuniversities unsustainable. Research findings indicate that Hungarian\nuniversities perform poorly in sustainable purchasing and renewable energy use,\nbut their location and their efforts towards separate waste collection are\ntheir major competitive advantages. The main domains of university\nsustainability were also discussed. This study provides university\ndecision-makers and researchers with insightful results supporting the\ntransformation of traditional universities into sustainable, fourth-generation\nhigher education institutions.",

Yet, there was a rise of\nnearly 30% in the number of emigration crossings of male adults travelling with\ntheir children.

For a one-point reduction in the\nnumber of children deported from the US to Guatemalan municipalities, there was\nan increase of nearly 14 in the number of crossings made by adult males leaving\nfrom Guatemala for Mexico; and nearly 0.5 additional crossings made by male\nadults travelling with their children.

During this period, air pollution in\nthe analysed Guatemalan municipalities fell by 4%, night light per capita fell\nby 15%, and homicide rates fell by 40%. Unlike in previous years, emigrants are\nfleeing poverty rather than violence. Our findings suggest that a reduction in\nviolence alone will not be sufficient to reduce emigration flows from Central\nAmerica, but that economic recovery is needed.",

We first cover several case studies of current ad hoc stablecoin\nissuance and redemption mechanisms, several of which have contributed to recent\nstablecoin de-peggings, and formulate desirable properties of a P-AMM that\nsupport stability and usability. We then design a P-AMM redemption curve and\nshow that it satisfies these properties, including bounded loss for both the\nprotocol and stablecoin holders. We further show that this redemption curve is\npath independent and has properties of path deficiency in extended settings\ninvolving trading fees and a separate minting curve. This means that system\nhealth weakly improves relative to the path independent setting along any\ntrading curve and that there is no incentive to strategically subdivide\nredemptions.

Hence, in this work we consider\ndifferent types of embodied energy sources and the time evolution of the\nsectors' and countries' interactions. Flows are indeed used to construct a\ndirected and weighted temporal multilayer network based respectively on\nrenewable and non-renewable sources, where sectors are nodes and layers are\ncountries. We provide a methodological approach for analysing the network\nreliability and resilience and for identifying critical sectors and economies\nin the system by applying the Multi-Dimensional HITS algorithm. Then, we\nevaluate central arcs in the network at each time period by proposing a novel\ntopological indicator based on the maximum flow problem. In this way, we\nprovide a full view of economies, sectors and connections that play a relevant\nrole over time in the network and whose removal could heavily affect the\nstability of the system. We provide a numerical analysis based on the embodied\nenergy flows among countries and sectors in the period from 1990 to 2016.\nResults prove that the methods are effective in catching the different patterns\nbetween renewable and non-renewable energy sources.",

However, delegation must be used sparely because it reduces\nthe information aggregated through voting. In two different experiments, we\nfind that delegation underperforms both universal majority voting and the\nsimpler option of abstention. In a tightly controlled lab experiment where the\nsubjects' precision of information is conveyed in precise mathematical terms\nand very salient, the result is due to overdelegation. In a perceptual task run\nonline where the precision of information is not known precisely, delegation\nremains very high and again underperforms both majority voting and abstention.\nIn addition, subjects substantially overestimate the precision of the better\ninformed voters, underlining that Liquid Democracy is fragile to multiple\nsources of noise. The paper makes an innovative methodological contribution by\ncombining two very different experimental procedures: the study of voting rules\nwould benefit from complementing controlled experiments with known precision of\ninformation with tests under ambiguity, a realistic assumption in many voting\nsituations.",

Second, net\ncarbon exporters exacerbate this wedge to increase producer surplus of their\ncarbon resource producers, implying even larger removal subsidies.

As more scientists and\nengineers adopt deep learning, it is important to consider what effect\nwidespread deployment would have on scientific progress and, ultimately,\neconomic growth. We assess this impact by estimating the idea production\nfunction for AI in two computer vision tasks that are considered key test-beds\nfor deep learning and show that AI idea production is notably more\ncapital-intensive than traditional R&D. Because increasing the\ncapital-intensity of R&D accelerates the investments that make scientists and\nengineers more productive, our work suggests that AI-augmented R&D has the\npotential to speed up technological change and economic growth.",

The definition is equivalent to the ones\ngiven by Frisch in 1926 and by Shapley in 1975 and postulates axioms on a set\nof alternatives that allow both to ordinally rank alternatives and to compare\ntheir utility differences. After a brief review of the philosophy of\nutilitarianism and the history of utility theory, the paper introduces the\nmathematical framework to represent intensity comparisons of utility and proves\na list of topological lemmas that will be used in the main result. Finally, the\narticle states and proves a representation theorem for a measurable utility\nfunction defined on a connected and separable subset of a weakly ordered\ntopological space equipped with another weak order on its cartesian product.\nUnder some assumptions on the order relations, the main theorem proves\nexistence and uniqueness, up to positive affine transformations, of an order\nisomorphism with the real line.",

This\nincident has prompted the Aave community to consider changes to its liquidation\nthreshold, and limitations on the number of illiquid coins that can be borrowed\non the platform. In this paper, we argue that the bad debt incurred by AAVE was\nnot due to excess volatility in CRV/USDC price activity on that day, but rather\na fundamental flaw in the liquidation logic which triggered a toxic liquidation\nspiral on the platform. We note that this flaw, which is shared by a number of\nmajor DeFi lending markets, can be easily overcome with simple changes to the\nincentives driving liquidations. We claim that halting all liquidations once a\nuser's loan-to-value (LTV) ratio surpasses a certain threshold value can\nprevent future toxic liquidation spirals and offer substantial improvement in\nthe bad debt that a lending market can expect to incur. Furthermore, we\nstrongly argue that protocols should enact dynamic liquidation incentives and\nclosing factor policies moving forward for optimal management of protocol risk.",

In\nturn, segregation and inequalities are common features of most cities and\nlocations that enable the meeting of people with different socio-economic\nstatus are key for urban inclusion. In this study, we adopt the concept of\neconomic complexity to quantify the sophistication of amenity supply at urban\nlocations. We propose that neighborhood complexity and amenity complexity are\nconnected to the ability of locations to attract diverse visitors from various\nsocio-economic backgrounds across the city. We construct the measures of\namenity complexity based on the local portfolio of diverse and non-ubiquitous\namenities in Budapest, Hungary. Socio-economic mixing at visited third places\nis investigated by tracing the daily mobility of individuals and by\ncharacterizing their status by the real-estate price of their home locations.\nResults suggest that measures of ubiquity and diversity of amenities do not,\nbut neighborhood complexity and amenity complexity are correlated with the\nurban centrality of locations. Urban centrality is a strong predictor of\nsocio-economic mixing, but both neighborhood complexity and amenity complexity\nadd further explanatory power to our models. Our work combines urban mobility\ndata with economic complexity thinking to show that the diversity of\nnon-ubiquitous amenities, central locations, and the potentials for\nsocio-economic mixing are interrelated.",

        "abstract": "Electricity markets are transforming from the dominance of conventional\nenergy resources (CERs), e.g., fossil fuels, to low-carbon energy resources\n(LERs), e.g., renewables and energy storage. This work examines market\nmechanisms to incentivize LER investments, while ensuring adequate market\nrevenues for investors, guiding investors' strategic investments towards social\noptimum, and protecting consumers from scarcity prices. To reduce the impact of\nexcessive scarcity prices, we present a new market mechanism, which consists of\na Penalty payment for lost load, a supply Incentive, and an energy price Uplift\n(PIU). We establish a game-theoretical framework to analyze market equilibrium.\nWe prove that one Nash equilibrium under the penalty payment and supply\nincentive can reach the social optimum given quadratic supply costs of CERs.\nAlthough the price uplift can ensure adequate revenues, the resulting system\ncost deviates from the social optimum while the gap decreases as more CERs\nretire. Furthermore, under the traditional marginal-cost pricing (MCP)\nmechanism, investors may withhold investments to cause scarcity prices, but\nsuch behavior is absent under the PIU mechanism. Simulation results show that\nthe PIU mechanism can reduce consumers' costs by over 30% compared with the MCP\nmechanism by reducing excessive revenues of low-cost CERs from scarcity prices.",

Using\nNorth Carolina court cases from 1994 to 2009, this paper evaluates how mandated\nmental health treatment as a term of probation impacts the likelihood that\nindividuals return to the criminal justice system. I use random variation in\njudge assignment to compare those who were required to seek weekly mental\nhealth counseling to those who were not. The main findings are that being\nassigned to seek mental health treatment decreases the likelihood of three-year\nrecidivism by about 12 percentage points, or 36 percent. This effect persists\nover time, and is similar among various types of individuals on probation. In\naddition, I show that mental health treatment operates distinctly from drug\naddiction interventions in a multiple-treatment framework. I provide evidence\nthat mental health treatment's longer-term effectiveness is strongest among\nmore financially-advantaged probationers, consistent with this setting, in\nwhich the cost of mandated treatment is shouldered by offenders. Finally,\nconservative calculations result in a 5:1 benefit-to-cost ratio which suggests\nthat the treatment-induced decrease in future crime would be more than\nsufficient to offset the costs of treatment.",

However, many recent studies have\nfound that decentralized banks have not achieved a significant degree of\ndecentralization. This research conducts a comparative study among mainstream\ndecentralized banks. We apply core-periphery network features analysis using\nthe transaction data from four decentralized banks, Liquity, Aave, MakerDao,\nand Compound. We extract six features and compare the banks' levels of\ndecentralization cross-sectionally. According to the analysis results, we find\nthat: 1) MakerDao and Compound are more decentralized in the transactions than\nAave and Liquity. 2) Although decentralized banking transactions are supposed\nto be decentralized, the data show that four banks have primary external\ntransaction core addresses such as Huobi, Coinbase, and Binance, etc. We also\ndiscuss four design features that might affect network decentralization. Our\nresearch contributes to the literature at the interface of decentralized\nfinance, financial technology (Fintech), and social network analysis and\ninspires future protocol designs to live up to the promise of decentralized\nfinance for a truly peer-to-peer transaction network.",

        "abstract": "Cooperation is fundamental for human prosperity. Blockchain, as a trust\nmachine, is a cooperative institution in cyberspace that supports cooperation\nthrough distributed trust with consensus protocols. While studies in computer\nscience focus on fault tolerance problems with consensus algorithms, economic\nresearch utilizes incentive designs to analyze agent behaviors. To achieve\ncooperation on blockchains, emerging interdisciplinary research introduces\nrationality and game-theoretical solution concepts to study the equilibrium\noutcomes of various consensus protocols. However, existing studies do not\nconsider the possibility for agents to learn from historical observations.\nTherefore, we abstract a general consensus protocol as a dynamic game\nenvironment, apply a solution concept of bounded rationality to model agent\nbehavior, and resolve the initial conditions for three different stable\nequilibria. In our game, agents imitatively learn the global history in an\nevolutionary process toward equilibria, for which we evaluate the outcomes from\nboth computing and economic perspectives in terms of safety, liveness,\nvalidity, and social welfare. Our research contributes to the literature across\ndisciplines, including distributed consensus in computer science, game theory\nin economics on blockchain consensus, evolutionary game theory at the\nintersection of biology and economics, bounded rationality at the interplay\nbetween psychology and economics, and cooperative AI with joint insights into\ncomputing and social science. Finally, we discuss that future protocol design\ncan better achieve the most desired outcomes of our honest stable equilibria by\nincreasing the reward-punishment ratio and lowering both the cost-punishment\nratio and the pivotality rate.",

        "abstract": "This research article explores potential influencing factors of solar\nphotovoltaic (PV) system adoption by municipal authorities in Germany in the\nyear 2019. We derive seven hypothesized relationships from the empirical\nliterature on residential PV adoption, organizational technology adoption, and\nsustainability policy adoption by local governments, and apply a twofold\nempirical approach to examine them. First, we explore the associations of a set\nof explanatory variables on the installed capacity of adopter municipalities\n(N=223) in an OLS model. Second, we use a logit model to analyze whether the\nidentified relationships are also apparent between adopter and non-adopter\nmunicipalities (N=423). Our findings suggest that fiscal capacity (measured by\nper capita debt and per capita tax revenue) and peer effects (measured by the\npre-existing installed capacity) are positively associated with both the\ninstalled capacity and adoption. Furthermore, we find that institutional\ncapacity (measured by the presence of a municipal utility) and environmental\nconcern (measured by the share of green party votes) are positively associated\nwith municipal PV adoption. Economic factors (measured by solar irradiation)\nshow a significant positive but small effect in both regression models. No\nevidence was found to support the influence of political will. Results for the\nrole of municipal characteristics are mixed, although the population size was\nconsistently positively associated with municipal PV adoption and installed\ncapacity. Our results support previous studies on PV system adoption\ndeterminants and offer a starting point for additional research on\nnon-residential decision-making and PV adoption.",

To fill\nthis gap, we introduce a data-driven, granular, agent-based model that\nsimulates epidemic and economic outcomes across industries, occupations, and\nincome levels with geographic realism. The key mechanism coupling the epidemic\nand economic modules is the reduction in consumption demand due to fear of\ninfection. We calibrate the model to the first wave of COVID-19 in the New York\nmetropolitan area, showing that it reproduces key epidemic and economic\nstatistics, and then examine counterfactual scenarios. We find that: (a) both\nhigh fear of infection and strict restrictions similarly harm the economy but\nreduce infections; (b) low-income workers bear the brunt of both the economic\nand epidemic harm; (c) closing non-customer-facing industries such as\nmanufacturing and construction only marginally reduces the death toll while\nconsiderably increasing unemployment; and (d) delaying the start of protective\nmeasures does little to help the economy and worsens epidemic outcomes in all\nscenarios.

We relied on a three-step estimation strategy: i) estimation of\nproduction functions, ii) evaluation of TFP, and iii) assessment of the\nrelationship between CAP subsidies and TFP. To overcome multiple endogeneity\nproblems, the System-GMM estimator is adopted. The investigation embraces farms\nin France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom using the FADN\nsamples from 2008 to 2018. Adding to previous analyses, we compare results from\ndifferent countries and investigate three subsets of farms with varying levels\nof TFP. The outcomes confirm how CAP negatively impacts farm TFP, but the\nextent differs according to the type of subsidies, the six countries and,\nwithin these, among farms with different productivity groups. Therefore there\nis room for policy improvements in order to foster the productivity of cereal\nfarms.",

One possible explanation for this is that occupations have become\nmore accommodating to the preferences of older workers. We explore this by\nconstructing an \"age-friendliness\" index for occupations. We use Natural\nLanguage Processing to measure the degree of overlap between textual\ndescriptions of occupations and characteristics which define age-friendliness.\nOur index provides an approximation to rankings produced by survey participants\nand has predictive power for the occupational share of older workers. We find\nthat between 1990 and 2020 around three quarters of occupations have seen their\nage-friendliness increase and employment in above-average age-friendly\noccupations has risen by 49 million. However, older workers have not benefited\ndisproportionately from this rise, with substantial gains going to younger\nfemales and college graduates and with male non-college educated workers losing\nout the most. These findings point to the need to frame the rise of\nage-friendly jobs in the context of other labour market trends and\nimperfections. Purely age-based policies are insufficient given both\nheterogeneity amongst older workers as well as similarities between groups of\nolder and younger workers. The latter is especially apparent in the overlapping\nappeal of specific occupational characteristics.",

Interestingly, we detect a positive correlation between the\ncomplexity of a product and the complexity of its explainers.",

To this end, we exploit the quasi-experimental framework created by\nthe first COVID-19 lockdown in a high-income economy--the unexpected Italian\nlockdown in February 2020. We measure changes in public sentiment using deep\nlearning and dictionary-based methods on the text of daily tweets geolocated\nwithin and near the locked-down areas, before and after the treatment. We\nclassify tweets into four categories--economics, health, politics, and lockdown\npolicy--to examine how the policy affected emotions heterogeneously. Using a\nstaggered difference-in-differences approach, we show that the lockdown did not\nhave a significantly robust impact on economic uncertainty and sentiment.\nHowever, the policy came at the price of higher uncertainty on health and\npolitics and more negative political sentiments. These results, which are\nrobust to a battery of robustness tests, show that lockdowns have relevant\nnon-health related implications.",

        "abstract": "The stock market's reaction to the external risk shock is closely related to\nthe cross-shareholding network structure. This paper takes the public\ninformation of listed companies in the A-share securities market as the primary\nsample to study the relationship between the stock return rate, market\nperformance, and network topology before and after China's stock market crash\nin 2015. Data visualization and empirical analysis demonstrate that the return\nrate of stocks is related to the company's traditional business ability and the\nsocial capital brought by cross-holding. Several heteroscedasticity tests and\nendogeneity tests with IV are conducted to support the robustness. The\nstructure of the cross-shareholding network experienced upheaval after the\nshock, even distorting the effects of market value, and assets holding on the\nreturn rate. The enterprises in the entire shareholding network are connected\nmore firmly to overcome systematic external risks. The number of enterprise\nclusters is significantly reduced during the process. Besides, the number of\nnewly established cross-shareholding relationships shows an outbreak, which may\nexplain the rapid maintenance of stability in the financial system. When stable\nclustering is formed before and after a stock crash (rather than when it\noccurs), the clustering coefficient of clear clustering still has an apparent\npositive influence on the return rate of stocks. To sum up, the compacted\nnetwork may prevent the firms from pursuing aggressive earning before the\nfinancial crisis, but would protect firms from suffering relatively high losses\nduring and after the shock.",

Firms increase non-business expenditures\nand retained earnings as a financial measure to resist series risk during the\nshock period.

        "abstract": "Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Western countries have looked for\nways to limit Russia's oil income. This paper considers, theoretically and\nquantitatively, two such options: 1) an export-quantity restriction and 2) a\nforced discount on Russian oil. We build a quantifiable model of the global oil\nmarket and analyze how each of these policies affect: which Russian oil fields\nfall out of production; the global oil supply; and the global oil price. By\nthese statics we derive the effects of the policies on Russian oil profits and\noil-importers' economic surplus. The effects on Russian oil profits are\nsubstantial. In the short run (within the first year), a quantity restriction\nof 20% yields Russian losses of 62 million USD per day, equivalent to 1.2% of\nGDP and 32% of military spending. In the long run (beyond a year) new\ninvestments become unprofitable. Losses rise to 100 million USD per day, 2% of\nGDP and 56% of military spending. A price discount of 20% is even more harmful\nto Russia, yielding losses of 152 million USD per day, equivalent to 3.1% of\nGDP and 85% of military spending in the short run and long run. A price\ndiscount puts generally more burden on Russia and less on importers compared to\na quantity restriction. In fact, a price discount implies net gains for oil\nimporters as it essentially redistributes oil rents from Russia to importers.\nIf the restrictions are expected to last for long, the burden on oil importers\ndecreases. Overall, both policies at all levels imply larger relative losses\nfor Russia than for oil importers (in shares of their GDP). The case for a\nprice discount on Russian oil is thus strong. However, Russia may choose not to\nexport at the discounted price, in which case the price-discount sanction\nbecomes a de facto supply restriction.",

        "abstract": "Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) promise to revolutionize how content creators\n(e.g., artists) price and sell their work. One core feature of NFTs is the\noption to embed creator royalties which earmark a percentage of future sale\nproceeds to creators, each time their NFTs change hands. As popular as this\nfeature is in practice, its utility is often questioned because buyers, the\nargument goes, simply ``price it in at the time of purchase''. As intuitive as\nthis argument sounds, it is incomplete. We find royalties can add value to\ncreators in at least three distinct ways. (i) Risk sharing: when creators and\nbuyers are risk sensitive, royalties can improve trade by splitting the risks\nassociated with future price volatility; (ii) Dynamic pricing: in the presence\nof information asymmetry, royalties can extract more revenues from\nbetter-informed speculators over time, mimicking the benefits of ``dynamic\npricing''; (iii) Price discrimination: when creators sell multi-unit NFT\ncollections, royalties can better capture value from heterogeneous buyers. Our\nresults suggest creator royalties play an important and sometimes overlooked\nrole in the economics of NFTs.",

        "abstract": "Large amounts of evidence suggest that trust levels in a country are an\nimportant determinant of its macroeconomic growth. In this paper, we\ninvestigate one channel through which trust might support economic performance:\nthrough the levels of patience, also known as time preference in the economics\nliterature. Following Gabaix and Laibson (2017), we first argue that time\npreference can be modelled as optimal Bayesian inference based on noisy signals\nabout the future, so that it is affected by the perceived certainty of future\noutcomes. Drawing on neuroscience literature, we argue that the mechanism\nlinking trust and patience could be facilitated by the neurotransmitter\noxytocin. On the one hand, it is a neural correlate of trusting behavior. On\nthe other, it has an impact on the brain's encoding of prediction error, and\ncould therefore increase the perceived certainty of a neural representation of\na future event. The relationship between trust and time preference is tested\nexperimentally using the Trust Game. While the paper does not find a\nsignificant effect of trust on time preference or the levels of certainty, it\nproposes an experimental design that can successfully manipulate people's\nshort-term levels of trust for experimental purposes.",

Adjusting the\nmodel to the experience of the US economy, I show that joint variations in\nlabor institutions and technology are required to provide reasonable\nexplanations for the behavior of income shares, capital returns, unemployment,\nand the big ratios in macroeconomics. The model offers new perspectives on\nrecent trends by showing that they can be analyzed by the interrelation between\nthe profit-making capacity of capitalist economies and the political\nenvironment determining labor institutions.",

Based on two results from stochastic calculus, I show that\nthis decomposition is nonparametrically identified and can be estimated based\nsolely on repeated cross-sections of the data. I estimate it in the United\nStates since 1962 using historical data on income, wealth, and demography. I\nfind that the main drivers of the rise of the top 1% wealth share since the\n1980s have been, in decreasing level of importance, higher savings at the top,\nhigher rates of return on wealth (essentially in the form of capital gains),\nand higher labor income inequality. I then use the model to study the effects\nof wealth taxation. I derive simple formulas for how the tax base reacts to the\nnet-of-tax rate in the long run, which nest insights from several existing\nmodels, and can be calibrated using estimable elasticities. In the benchmark\ncalibration, the revenue-maximizing wealth tax rate at the top is high (around\n12%), but the revenue collected from the tax is much lower than in the static\ncase.",

Due to the pandemic,\nissues in the supply chain and concerns about food shortage drove up the food\nprices. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the prices for food\nincreased 4.1% and 3.7% over the year ended in August 2020 and August 2021,\nrespectively, while the amount of annual increase in the food prices prior to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic is less than 2.0%. Previous studies show that such kinds\nof exogenous disasters, including the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake, 9/11 terrorist\nattacks, and major infectious diseases, and the resulted unusual food prices\noften led to subsequent changes in people's consumption behaviors. We\nhypothesize that the COVID-19 pandemic causes food price changes and the price\nchanges alter people's grocery shopping behaviors as well. To thoroughly\nexplore this, we formulate our analysis from two different perspectives, by\ncollecting data both globally, from China, Japan, United Kingdom, and United\nStates, and locally, from different groups of people inside the US. In\nparticular, we analyze the trends between food prices and COVID-19 as well as\nbetween food prices and spending, aiming to find out their correlations and the\nlessons for preparing the next pandemic.",

Next, I develop a method that allows instruments\nthat violate this condition to contribute to estimation of treatment effects by\nallowing them to place nonconvex, outcome-invariant weights on unobserved\ncomponent treatments across multiple outcomes. Finally, I apply the method to\nestimate returns to college, finding wage returns that range from 7\\% to 30\\%\nover the life cycle.

        "abstract": "The United States, much like other countries around the world, faces\nsignificant obstacles to achieving a rapid decarbonization of its economy.\nCrucially, decarbonization disproportionately affects the communities that have\nbeen historically, politically, and socially embedded in the nation's fossil\nfuel production. However, this effect has rarely been quantified in the\nliterature. Using econometric estimation methods that control for unobserved\nheterogeneity via two-way fixed effects, spatial effects, heterogeneous time\ntrends, and grouped fixed effects, we demonstrate that mine closures induce a\nsignificant and consistent contemporaneous rise in the unemployment rate across\nUS counties. A single mine closure can raise a county's unemployment rate by\n0.056 percentage points in a given year; this effect is amplified by a factor\nof four when spatial econometric dynamics are considered. Although this\nresponse in the unemployment rate fades within 2-3 years, it has far-reaching\neffects in its immediate vicinity. Furthermore, we use cluster analysis to\nbuild a novel typology of coal counties based on qualities that are thought to\nfacilitate a successful recovery in the face of local industrial decline. The\ncombined findings of the econometric analysis and typology point to the\nimportance of investing in alternative sectors in places with promising levels\nof economic diversity, retraining job seekers in places with lower levels of\neducational attainment, providing relocation (or telecommuting) support in\nrural areas, and subsidizing childcare and after school programs in places with\nlow female labor force participation due to the gendered division of domestic\nwork.",

Descriptive\nstatistics and qualitative analysis have been adopted. The results show land\nlease revenue is a dominant source of extra-budgetary revenue for Bahir Dar\ncity. As evidenced by Bahir Dar city, a significant portion of urban\ninfrastructure expenditure is financed by revenues from land leasing. However,\ndespite the critical importance of land lease revenue to investments in urban\ninfrastructure, there is inefficiency in the collection of potential lease\nrevenue due to weak information exchange, inadequate land provision for various\nuses, lack of transparency in tender committees, and the existence of poor\ndocumentation.

In this work, we used deep multi-agent\nreinforcement learning to solve an energy systems wargame wherein players\nsimulate IOC decision-making, including hydrocarbon and low-carbon investments\ndecisions, dividend policies, and capital structure measures, through an\nuncertain energy transition to explore critical and non-linear governance\nquestions, from leveraged transitions to reserve replacements.

In all\ngames, robust strategies emerged in the form of low-carbon business models as a\nresult of early transition-oriented movement. IOCs adopting such strategies\noutperformed business-as-usual and delayed transition strategies regardless of\nhydrocarbon demand projections. In addition to maximizing value, these\nstrategies benefit greater society by contributing substantial amounts of\ncapital necessary to accelerate the global low-carbon energy transition.

The analysis of Emerging Markets (EM) economies generally\nassumes collateral borrowing constraints, i.e., firms access to debt is\nconstrained by the value of their collateralized assets. Using credit registry\ndata from Argentina for the period 1998-2020 we show that less than 15% of\nfirms debt is based on the value of collateralized assets, with the remaining\n85% based on firms cash flows. Exploiting central bank regulations over banks\ncapital requirements and credit policies we argue that the most prevalent\nborrowing constraints is defined in terms of the ratio of their interest\npayments to a measure of their present and past cash flows, akin to the\ninterest coverage borrowing constraint studied by the corporate finance\nliterature. Lastly, we argue that EMs exhibit a greater share of interest\nsensitive borrowing constraints than the US and other Advanced Economies. From\na structural point of view, we show that in an otherwise standard small open\neconomy DSGE model, an interest coverage borrowing constraints leads to\nsignificantly stronger amplification of foreign interest rate shocks compared\nto the standard collateral constraint. This greater amplification provides a\nsolution to the Spillover Puzzle of US monetary policy rates by which EMs\nexperience greater negative effects than Advanced Economies after a US interest\nrate hike. In terms of policy implications, this greater amplification leads to\nmanaged exchange rate policy being more costly in the presence of an interest\ncoverage constraint, given their greater interest rate sensitivity, compared to\nthe standard collateral borrowing constraint.",

We find that there is\nindeed significant association between trade networks' complexity and global\nGDP across almost every sector, and that network metrics also correlate with\nbusiness cycle phenomena such as the Great Recession of 2007-2008. Our results\nshow that trade volume alone cannot explain global GDP growth, and that network\nscience may prove to be a valuable empirical avenue for studying complexity in\nmacro-economic phenomena such as trade.",

        "abstract": "In spring 2022, the German federal government agreed on a set of measures\nthat aim at reducing households' financial burden resulting from a recent price\nincrease, especially in energy and mobility. These measures include among\nothers, a nation-wide public transport ticket for 9 EUR per month and a fuel\ntax cut that reduces fuel prices by more than 15%. In transportation research\nthis is an almost unprecedented behavioral experiment. It allows to study not\nonly behavioral responses in mode choice and induced demand but also to assess\nthe effectiveness of transport policy instruments. We observe this natural\nexperiment with a three-wave survey and an app-based travel diary on a sample\nof hundreds of participants as well as an analysis of traffic counts. In this\nfifth report, we present first analyses of the recorded tracking data. 910\nparticipants completed the tracking until September, 30th. First, an overview\nover the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants within our\ntracking sample is given. We observe an adequate representation of female and\nmale participants, a slight over-representation of young participants, and an\nincome distribution similar to the one known from the \"Mobilit\\\"at in\nDeutschland\" survey. Most participants of the tracking study live in Munich,\nGermany. General transportation statistics are derived from the data for all\nphases of the natural experiment - prior, during, and after the 9 EUR-Ticket -\nto assess potential changes in the participants' travel behavior on an\naggregated level. A significant impact of the 9 EUR-Ticket on modal shares can\nbe seen. An analysis of the participants' mobility behavior considering trip\npurposes, age, and income sheds light on how the 9 EUR-Ticket impacts different\nsocial groups and activities. We find that age, income, and trip purpose\nsignificantly influence the impact of the 9 EUR-Ticket on the observed modal\nsplit.",

We estimate that Mentoring increases the\nprobability of finding a technology job within four months from 29% to 42% and\nChallenges from 20% to 29%, and the treatment effects do not attenuate over 12\nmonths. Since both programs are capacity constrained in practice (only 28% of\napplicants can be accommodated), we evaluate the effectiveness of several\nalternative prioritization rules based on applicant characteristics. We find\nthat a policy that selects applicants based on their predicted treatment\neffects increases the average treatment effect across the two programs to 22\npercentage points. We further analyze how alternative prioritization rules\ncompare to the selection that mentors used. We find that mentors selected\napplicants who were more likely to get a tech job even without participating in\nthe program, and the treatment effect for applicants with similar\ncharacteristics to those selected by mentors is about half of the effect\nattainable when participants are prioritized optimally.",

In\nWest Africa, water access in ancient periods predicts the locations of the core\ncities of inland trade routes -- the trans-Saharan caravan routes -- founded up\nto the 1800s, when historical Islamic states played significant economic roles\nbefore European colonization. In contrast, ancient water access does not have a\npersistent influence on contemporary city formation and economic activities.\nAfter European colonization and the invention of modern trading technologies,\nalong with the constant shrinking of water sources, landlocked pre-colonial\ncore cities contracted or became extinct. Employing an instrumental variable\nstrategy, we show that these deserted locations have today been replaced by\nbattlefields for jihadist organizations. We argue that the power relations\nbetween Islamic states and the European military during the 19th century\ncolonial era shaped the persistence of jihadist ideology as a legacy of\ncolonization. Investigations into religious ideology related to jihadism, using\nindividual-level surveys from Muslims, support this mechanism. Moreover, the\nconcentration of jihadist violence in \"past-core-and-present-periphery\" areas\nin West Africa is consistent with a global-scale phenomenon.

It was\nclosely related to the annual rate of growth in GDP per capita, and it was\nsignificantly weaker in the period 2014 to 2019 compared to the period 2000 to\n2007. This also corresponded with a weaker rate of growth in annual average\nreal wages over the period 2014 to 2019 compared to the period 2000 to 2007.\nThroughout the period 2000 to 2019, UK CPI was maintained, on average, at\napproximately 2.1% per annum. More rapid UK economic growth would be expected\nto be achieved by sustained investment in measures that enhance labour\nproductivity, with the further expectation that a sustained improvement in\nlabour productivity would increase the annual rate of growth of UK GDP per\ncapita and average real wages. While the results given in this paper are\nspecific to the UK over the time period 2000 to 2019, the expectation is that\nthe methodology and approach adopted can be applied to quantifying the dynamics\nof any developed economy over any time period.",

        "abstract": "Oil price fluctuations severely impact the economies of both oil-exporting\nand importing countries. High oil prices can benefit oil exporters by\nincreasing foreign currency inflow; however, an economy can suffer from a\nweakening of the manufacturing sectors and experience a significant downtrend\nin the country's price competitiveness as the domestic currency appreciates. We\ninvestigate the oil price fluctuations from Q1, 2004 to Q3, 2021 and their\nimpact on the Russian macroeconomic indicators, particularly industrial\nproduction, exchange rate, inflation and interest rates. We assess whether and\nhow much the Russian macroeconomic variables have been responsive to the oil\nprice fluctuations in recent years. The outcomes from VAR model confirm that\nthe monetary channel is more responsive to oil price shocks than the fiscal\none. Regarding fiscal channel of the oil price impact, industrial production is\nstrongly pro-cyclical to oil price shocks. As for the monetary channel, higher\noil price volatility is pressuring the Russian ruble, inflation and interest\nrates are substantially counter-cyclical to oil price shocks.",

        "abstract": "Almost every public pension system shares two attributes: earning deductions\nto finance benefits, and benefits that depend on earnings. This paper analyzes\ntheoretically and empirically the trade-off between social insurance and\nincentive provision faced by reforms to these two attributes. First, I combine\nthe social insurance and the optimal linear-income literature to build a model\nwith a flexible pension contribution rate and benefits' progressivity that\nincorporates inter-temporal and inter-worker types of redistribution and\nincentive distortion. The model is general, allowing workers to be\nheterogeneous on productivity and retirement preparedness, and they exhibit\npresent-focused bias. I then estimate the model by leveraging three\nquasi-experimental variations on the design of the Chilean pension system and\nadministrative data merged with a panel survey. I find that taxable earnings\nrespond to changes in the benefit-earnings link, future pension payments, and\nnet-of-tax rate, which increases the costs of reforms. I also find that\nlifetime payroll earnings have a strong positive relationship with productivity\nand retirement preparedness, and that pension transfers are effective in\nincreasing retirement consumption. Therefore, there is a large inter-worker\nredistribution value through the pension system. Overall, there are significant\nsocial gains from marginal reforms: a 1% increase in the contribution rate and\nin the benefit progressivity generates social gains of 0.08% and 0.29% of the\nGDP, respectively. The optimal design has a pension contribution rate of 17%\nand focuses 42% of pension public spending on workers below the median of\nlifetime earnings.",

Furthermore, we propose a\nsimple and intuitive way to measure the degree to which a wrong assumption with\nrespect to the utility function of an investor will affect the structure of his\nportfolio. Our method is built on a two asset portfolio framework. Namely, a\nportfolio consisting of one risky and one risk-free asset.

Under normal demand conditions, introducing\nadditional renewable generation capacity reduces net demand. Consequently, the\nlockdown can provide insights about electricity market performance with a large\nshare of renewables. We find that although the lockdown reduced average\nday-ahead prices in Italy by 45%, re-dispatch costs increased by 73%, both\nrelative to the average of the same magnitude for the same period in previous\nyears. We estimate a deep-learning model using data from 2017--2019 and find\nthat predicted re-dispatch costs during the lockdown period are only 26% higher\nthan the same period in previous years. We argue that the difference between\nactual and predicted lockdown period re-dispatch costs is the result of\nincreased opportunities for suppliers with controllable units to exercise\nmarket power in the re-dispatch market in these persistently low net demand\nconditions. Our results imply that without grid investments and other\ntechnologies to manage low net demand conditions, an increased share of\nintermittent renewables is likely to increase costs of maintaining a reliable\ngrid.",

        "abstract": "Many online retailers and search intermediaries present products on ranked\nproduct lists. Because changing the ordering of products influences their\nrevenues and consumer welfare, these platforms can design rankings to maximize\neither of these two metrics. In this paper, I study how rankings serving these\ntwo objectives differ and what determines this difference. First, I highlight\nthat when position effects are heterogeneous, rankings can increase both\nrevenues and consumer welfare by increasing the overall conversion rate.\nSecond, I provide empirical evidence for this heterogeneity, highlighting that\ncheaper alternatives have stronger position effects. Finally, I quantify\nrevenue and consumer welfare effects across the different rankings. To this\nend, I develop an estimation procedure for the search and discovery model of\nGreminger (2022) that yields a smooth likelihood function by construction. The\nresults from the model show that rankings designed to maximize revenues can\nalso increase consumer welfare. Moreover, these revenue-based rankings reduce\nconsumer welfare only to a limited extent relative to a\nconsumer-welfare-maximizing ranking.",

These block groups are investigated and mapped for the 83 cities with\npopulations above 250,000, as well as at the state level and for places of all\nsizes. Detroit is shown to indeed be unique not only for its levels of\ndeprivation (which are higher than 95 percent of the country), but also for the\ndispersion of highly-deprived block groups throughout the city. Smaller, more\nconcentrated pockets of high deprivation can be found in nearly every large\ncity, and some cities below 20,000 residents have an even larger share of\nhigh-deprivation areas.

        "abstract": "There are a multitude of Blockchain-based physical infrastructure systems,\noperating on a crypto-currency enabled token economy, where infrastructure\nsuppliers are rewarded with tokens for enabling, validating, managing and/or\nsecuring the system. However, today's token economies are largely designed\nwithout infrastructure systems in mind, and often operate with a fixed token\nsupply (e.g., Bitcoin). This paper argues that token economies for\ninfrastructure networks should be structured differently - they should\ncontinually incentivize new suppliers to join the network to provide services\nand support to the ecosystem. As such, the associated token rewards should\ngracefully scale with the size of the decentralized system, but should be\ncarefully balanced with consumer demand to manage inflation and be designed to\nultimately reach an equilibrium. To achieve such an equilibrium, the\ndecentralized token economy should be adaptable and controllable so that it\nmaximizes the total utility of all users, such as achieving stable (overall\nnon-inflationary) token economies.\n  Our main contribution is to model infrastructure token economies as dynamical\nsystems - the circulating token supply, price, and consumer demand change as a\nfunction of the payment to nodes and costs to consumers for infrastructure\nservices. Crucially, this dynamical systems view enables us to leverage tools\nfrom mathematical control theory to optimize the overall decentralized\nnetwork's performance. Moreover, our model extends easily to a Stackelberg game\nbetween the controller and the nodes, which we use for robust, strategic\npricing. In short, we develop predictive, optimization-based controllers that\noutperform traditional algorithmic stablecoin heuristics by up to $2.4 \\times$\nin simulations based on real demand data from existing decentralized wireless\nnetworks.",

But no\nquantified evidence has been brought to date. We propose the first\nenvironmental quantification of the impact of Building Information Modeling\n(BIM) in the construction sector. Specifically, the direct and indirect\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by a monofunctional BIM to plan road\nmaintenance, a Pavement Management System (PMS), are evaluated using field data\nfrom France. The related carbon footprints are calculated following a life\ncycle approach, using different sources of data, including ecoinvent v3.6, and\nthe IPCC 2013 GWP 100a characterization factors. Three design-build-maintain\npavement alternatives are compared: scenario 1 relates to a massive design and\nsurface maintenance, scenario 2 to a progressive design and pre-planned\nstructural maintenance, and scenario 3 to a progressive design and tailored\nstructural maintenance supported by the PMS. First, results show negligible\ndirect emissions due to the PMS existence: 0.02% of the life cycle emissions of\nscenario 3. Second, complementary sensitivity analyses show that using a PMS is\nclimate-positive over the life cycle when pavement subgrade bearing capacity\nimproves over time, and climate-neutral otherwise. The GHG emissions savings\nusing BIM can reach up to 30% of the life cycle emissions compared to other\nscenarios, and 65% when restraining the scope to maintenance and rehabilitation\nand excluding original pavement construction. Third, the neutral effect of BIM\nin case of a deterioration of the bearing capacity of the subgrade may be\nexplained by design practices and safety margins, that could be enhanced using\nBIM. Fourth, the decarbonization potential of a multifunctional BIM is\ndiscussed, and research perspectives are presented.",

        "title": "How a Brand's Social Activism Impacts Consumers' Brand Evaluations: The Role of Brand Relationship Norms",
        "abstract": "With the proliferation of social activism online, brands face heightened\npressure from consumers to publicly address these issues. Yet, the optimal\nbrand response strategy (i.e., whether and how to respond) in these contexts\nremains unclear. This research investigates consumers' reactions to brand\nresponse strategies (e.g., engage vs. not) during social activism and offers\npotentially effective responses that brands can employ to engage in these\nissues. By analyzing real-world data collected from Twitter and conducting four\nrandomized experiments, this research discovers that brand relationship type\n(exchange, communal) affects consumers' brand evaluations in the wake of social\nactivism. Communal (vs. exchange) brands are evaluated less favorably when they\ndo not respond or utilize a low-empathy response. This difference is attenuated\nwhen brands employ a high-empathy response. These findings are attributable to\nconsumers' perceptions of whether the brand's response strategy complies with\nrelationship norms during social activism. The effects persist across activism\nevents that vary in their political polarization. This research contributes to\nthe literatures on brand engagement in social activism, brand relationships,\nand crisis communication. The findings also offer guidance to practitioners on\ncrafting response strategies during social activism and aid activists in\nsecuring brand support for societal benefits.",

        "abstract": "In spring 2022, the German federal government agreed on a set of measures\nthat aimed at reducing households' financial burden resulting from a recent\nprice increase, especially in energy and mobility. These measures included\namong others, a nation-wide public transport ticket for 9EUR per month and a\nfuel tax cut that reduced fuel prices by more than 15%. In transportation\npolicy and travel behavior research this is an almost unprecedented behavioral\nexperiment. It allows to study not only behavioral responses in mode choice and\ninduced demand but also to assess the effectiveness of transport policy\ninstruments. We observe this natural experiment with a three-wave survey and an\napp-based travel diary on a sample 2'263 individuals; for the Munich Study, 919\nparticipants in the survey-and-app group and 425 in the survey-only group have\nbeen successfully recruited, while 919 participants have been recruited through\na professional panel provider to obtain a representative nation-wide reference\ngroup for the three-wave survey. In this fourth report we present the results\nof the third wave. At the end of the study, all three surveys have been\ncompleted by 1'484 participants and 642 participants completed all three\nsurveys and used the travel diary throughout the entire study. Based on our\nresults we conclude that when offering a 49EUR-Ticket as a successor to the\n9~EUR-Ticket and a local travel pass for 30EUR/month more than 60% of all\n9~EUR-Ticket owners would buy one of the two new travel passes. In other words,\na substantial increase in travel pass ownership in Germany can be expected,\nwith our modest estimate being around 20%. With the announcement of the\nintroduction of a successor ticket in 2023 as well as with the prevailing high\ninflation, this study will continue into the year 2023 to monitor the impact on\nmobility and daily activities.",

        "abstract": "In a 3-2 split verdict, the Supreme Court approved the exclusion of India's\nsocially and economically backward classes from its affirmative action measures\nto address economic deprivation. Dissenting justices, including the Chief\nJustice of India, protested the Majority Opinion for sanctioning \"an avowedly\nexclusionary and discriminatory principle.\" To justify their controversial\ndecision, the majority justices relied on technical arguments that are\ncategorically false. The confusion of the justices is due to a subtle technical\naspect of the affirmative action system in India: the significance of overlaps\nbetween members of protected groups. Conventionally, protected classes were\ndetermined by the caste system, which meant they did not overlap. The addition\nof a new protected class defined by economic criteria alters this structure,\nunless it is artificially enforced. The majority justices failed to appreciate\nthe significance of this critical change and inaccurately argued that the\ncontroversial exclusion is a technical necessity to provide benefits to\npreviously unprotected members of a new class. We show that this case could\nhave been resolved with three competing policies that each avoid the\ncontroversial exclusion. One of these policies aligns with the core arguments\nin the Majority Opinion, whereas a second aligns with those in the Dissenting\nOpinion.",

When electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps (HPs) are owned primarily\nby households with higher financial status than others, new tariff designs may\nclash with the economic argument for efficiency and the political arguments for\nfairness. This article combines tariff design and redistributive mechanisms to\nstrike a balance between time-differentiated signals, revenue stability for the\nutility, limited grid costs for vulnerable households, and promoting\nelectrification. We simulate the impacts of this combination on 1.4 million\nDanish households (about 50% of the country's population) and quantify the\ncross-subsidization effects between groups.

        "abstract": "Recently, V. Laure van Bambeke used an original approach to solve the famous\nproblem of transformation of values into production prices by considering that\ncapital reallocation to each department (branch) was part of the problem. Here,\nwe confirm the validity of this consideration in relation with the satisfaction\nof demand (social need which is able to pay for the given product). In contrast\nto V. Laure van Bambeke's method of solving an overdetermined system of\nequations (implying that compliance with Marx's fundamental equalities could\nonly be approached), we show that the transformation problem is solvable from a\ndetermined (two-branch models) or an underdetermined system of equations\nenabling to obtain exact solutions through an algorithm we provide, with no\napproximation needed. For systems with three branches or more, the solution of\nthe transformation problem belongs to an infinite ensemble, accounting for the\nobserved high competition-driven market fluidity. Furthermore, we show that the\ntransformation problem is solvable in the absence of fixed capital, supporting\nthat dealing with the latter is not essential and cannot be seen as a potential\nflaw of the approach. Our algorithm enables simulations illustrating how the\ntransient rise in the rate of profit predicted by the Okishio theorem is\nconsistent with the tendency of the rate of profit to fall (TRPF) subsequent to\ncapital reallocation, and how the TRPF is governed by the increase of organic\ncomposition, in value. We establish that the long-standing transformation\nproblem is not such a problem since it is easily solved through our algorithm,\nwhatever the number of branches considered. This emphasizes the high coherence\nof Marx's conception, and its impressive relevance regarding issues such as the\nTRPF, which have remained intensely debated.",

Of the 608 clusters, 115 received the same ratings from human\nexperts and the independent DHS rankings. For 59 percent of the clusters,\nexperts ratings were slightly lower. On the one hand, significant positive\npredictors of wealth are the presence of modern roofs and wider roads. For\ninstance, the log odds of receiving a rating in a higher quintile on the wealth\nrankings is 0.917 points higher on average for clusters with buildings with\nslate or tile roofing compared to those without. On the other hand, significant\nnegative predictors included poor road coverage, low to medium greenery\ncoverage, and low to medium building density. Other key predictors from the\nmultinomial regression model include settlement structure and farm sizes. These\nfindings are significant to the extent that these correlates of wealth and\npoverty are visually readable from satellite imagery and can be used to train\nmachine learning models in poverty predictions.

We show that if a TSO aims to maximize domestic total welfare, it often\nhas an incentive to reduce the capacity on the interconnectors to neighboring\ncountries.\n  In contrast with the (limited) literature on this subject, which focuses on\nincentives through the avoidance of future balancing costs, we show that\nincentives can exist even if one ignores balancing and focuses solely on\nwelfare gains in the day-ahead market itself. Our analysis consists of two\nparts. In the first part, we develop an analytical framework that explains why\nthese incentives exist. In particular, we distinguish two mechanisms: one based\non price differences with neighboring countries and one based on the domestic\nelectricity price. In the second part, we perform numerical experiments using a\nmodel of the Northern-European power system, focusing on the Danish TSO. In 97%\nof the historical hours tested, we indeed observe economic incentives for\ncapacity reductions, leading to significant welfare gains for Denmark and\nwelfare losses for the system as a whole. We show that the potential for\nwelfare gains greatly depends on the ability of the TSO to adapt interconnector\ncapacities to short-term market conditions. Finally, we explore the extent to\nwhich the recently introduced European \"70%-rule\" can mitigate the incentives\nfor capacity reductions and their welfare effects.",

Through\nsurveys of human subjects enrolled in the crowdsourcing platform Prolific.co\nand queries submitted to the OpenAI's language model GPT-3, I test whether the\nnumerical response for what wage is deemed fair for a particular job\ndescription changes when respondents and GPT-3 are prompted with additional\ninformation that includes a numerical minimum wage, whether realistic or\nunrealistic, relative to a control where no minimum wage is stated. I find that\nthe minimum wage influences the distribution of responses for the wage\nconsidered fair by shifting the mean response toward the minimum wage, thus\nestablishing the minimum wage's role as an anchor for judgements of fairness.\nHowever, for unrealistically high minimum wages, namely $50 and $100, the\ndistribution of responses splits into two distinct modes, one that\napproximately follows the anchor and one that remains close to the control,\nalbeit with an overall upward shift towards the anchor. The anchor exerts a\nsimilar effect on the AI bot; however, the wage that the AI bot perceives as\nfair exhibits a systematic downward shift compared to human subjects'\nresponses. For unrealistic values of the anchor, the responses of the bot also\nsplit into two modes but with a smaller proportion of the responses adhering to\nthe anchor compared to human subjects. As with human subjects, the remaining\nresponses are close to the control group for the AI bot but also exhibit a\nsystematic shift towards the anchor. During experimentation, I noted some\nvariability in the bot responses depending on small perturbations of the\nprompt, so I also test variability in the bot's responses with respect to more\nmeaningful differences in gender and race cues in the prompt, finding anomalies\nin the distribution of responses.",

        "abstract": "A long-standing discussion is to what extent patents can be used to monitor\ntrends in innovation activity. This study quantifies the amount and quality of\ninformation about actual innovation contained in the patent system, based on\n4,460 Swedish innovations (1970-2015) that have been matched to international\npatents. The results show that most innovations were not patented and that\namong those that were, 43.9% of all innovations, only a fraction can be\nidentified with patent quality data. The best-performing models identify 17% of\nall information about innovations, equivalent to an information loss of at\nleast 83%. Econometric tests also show that the fraction of innovations\nresponding to strengthened patent laws during the period were on average 8%\npercent. The overlap between the patent and innovation systems is hence more\nmodest than often assumed. This accentuates the need to, alongside patents,\ndevelop versatile approaches in order to induce and monitor various aspects of\ninnovation.",

The\ncrucial role of pipelines for the trade of natural gas determines a set of\nnetwork effects that are absent for other natural resources such as oil and\nminerals. Gas rents are not limited to producers but also accrue to key players\noccupying central nodes in the gas network. Drawing on our new gas pipeline\ndata, this paper shows that gas betweenness-centrality of a country increases\nsubstantially the ruler's grip on power as measured by leader turnover. A main\nmechanism at work is the reluctance of connected gas trade partners to impose\nsanctions, meaning that bad behavior of gas-central leaders is tolerated for\nlonger before being sanctioned. Overall, this reinforces the notion that fossil\nfuels are not just poison for the environment but also for political pluralism\nand healthy regime turnover.",

But which skills\nare a good investment for workers and firms? As skills are seldomly applied in\nisolation, we propose that complementarity strongly determines a skill's\neconomic value. For 962 skills, we demonstrate that their value is strongly\ndetermined by complementarity - that is, how many different skills, ideally of\nhigh value, a competency can be combined with. We show that the value of a\nskill is relative, as it depends on the skill background of the worker. For\nmost skills, their value is highest when used in combination with skills of a\ndifferent type. We put our model to the test with a set of skills related to\nArtificial Intelligence (AI). We find that AI skills are particularly valuable\n- increasing worker wages by 21% on average - because of their strong\ncomplementarities and their rising demand in recent years. The model and\nmetrics of our work can inform the policy and practice of digital re-skilling\nto reduce labour market mismatches.

        "abstract": "Distributed renewable resources owned by prosumers can be an effective way of\nfortifying grid resilience and enhancing sustainability. However, prosumers\nserve their own interests and their objectives are unlikely to align with that\nof society. This paper develops a bilevel model to study the optimal design of\nretail electricity tariffs considering the balance between economic efficiency\nand energy equity. The retail tariff entails a fixed charge and a volumetric\ncharge tied to electricity usage to recover utilities' fixed costs. We analyze\nsolution properties of the bilevel problem and prove an optimal rate design,\nwhich is to use fixed charges to recover fixed costs and to balance energy\nequity among different income groups. This suggests that programs similar to\nCARE (California Alternative Rate of Energy), which offer lower retail rates to\nlow-income households, are unlikely to be efficient, even if they are\npolitically appealing.",

        "abstract": "This study examines the roles of government spending and money supply on\nalleviating poverty in Africa. The study used 48 Sub-Saharan Africa countries\nfrom 2001 to 2017. The study employed one step and two-step system GMM and\nfound that both the procedures have similar results. Different specifications\nwere employed and the model selected was robust, with valid instruments and\nabsence of autocorrelation at the second order. The study revealed that\ngovernment spending and foreign direct investment have significant negative\ninfluence on reducing poverty while money supply has positive influence on the\nlevel of poverty in the region. The implication of the finding is that monetary\npolicy tool of money supply has no strong influence in combating the menace of\npoverty. The study therefore recommends that emphasis should be placed on\nincreasing more of government spending that would impact on the quality of life\nof the people in the region through multiplier effect, improving the financial\nsystem for effective monetary policy and attracting foreign direct inflows\nthrough enabling business environment in Africa.",

With a rapid\nincrease in the number of social media users over the last ten years, a new\nadvertising domain has become available for companies.

However, in social media\nadvertising, which is different from traditional advertising, creating content\nshould be produced and this content should be perceived in a short time by\nconsumers. To achieve this, it is necessary to build rapport with consumers and\nto present correctly what they wish to see in advertisements by creating\nawareness. In view of the increasing importance of social media advertising,\nthe study examines how consumer perceptions of Instagram advertisements affect\nadvertising value and brand awareness. This study was conducted with Generation\nY consumers on the basis of their Instagram habits, a popular social media app.\nFor this purpose, surveys were held with 665 participants who use Instagram.\nThe collected data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. According\nto the analysis results, Y generations perceptions of Instagram advertisements\nhave both a positive and negative impact on advertising value and brand\nawareness and brand associations.",

Second, we study the role of firms'\nfinancial heterogeneity in the transmission of US interest rate shocks by\nexploiting detailed balance sheet dataset from Chile. We find that more\nindebted firms experience greater drops in investment in response to a US\ntightening shock than less indebted firms.

Third, we rationalize this finding using a stylized model\nof heterogeneous firms subject to a tightening leverage constraint. Finally, we\npresent evidence in support of this hypothesis as well as robustness checks to\nour main results.

This paper investigates how a\nlarge-scale deployment of green hydrogen production affects the investments in\ntransmission and generation towards 2060, analyzes the North Sea area with the\nmain offshore wind projects, and assesses the development of an offshore energy\nhub. Results indicate that the hydrogen deployment has a tremendous impact on\nthe grid development in Europe and in the North Sea. Findings indicate that\ntotal power generation capacity increases around 50%. The offshore energy hub\nacts mainly as a power transmission asset, leads to a reduction in total\ngeneration capacity, and is central to unlock the offshore wind potential in\nthe North Sea. The effect of hydrogen deployment on power prices is\nmultifaceted. In regions where power prices have typically been lower than\nelsewhere in Europe, it is observed that hydrogen increases the power price\nconsiderably. However, as hydrogen flexibility relieves stress in high-demand\nperiods for the grid, power prices decrease in average for some countries. This\nsuggests that while the deployment of green hydrogen will lead to a significant\nincrease in power demand, power prices will not necessarily experience a large\nincrease.",

There have been increasing interests in utilizing\nfinancial tools, such as insurance, to help end-users hedge the potential risk\nof lost load due to renewable energy variability. With insurance, a user pays a\npremium fee to the utility, so that he will get compensated in case his demand\nis not fully satisfied. A proper insurance design needs to resolve the\nfollowing two challenges: (i) users' reliability preference is private\ninformation; and (ii) the insurance design is tightly coupled with the\nrenewable energy investment decision. To address these challenges, we adopt the\ncontract theory to elicit users' private reliability preferences, and we study\nhow the utility can jointly optimize the insurance contract and the planning of\nrenewable energy. A key analytical challenge is that the joint optimization of\nthe insurance design and the planning of renewables is non-convex. We resolve\nthis difficulty by revealing important structural properties of the optimal\nsolution, using the help of two benchmark problems: the no-insurance benchmark\nand the social-optimum benchmark. Compared with the no-insurance benchmark, we\nprove that the social cost and users' total energy cost are always no larger\nunder the optimal contract. Simulation results show that the largest benefit of\nthe insurance contract is achieved at a medium electricity-bill price together\nwith a low type heterogeneity and a high renewable uncertainty.",

Using Norwegian registry\ndata, I examine the inheritance-induced decline in inheritors' wages and\noccupational income. In contrast to prior research, my estimates allow the\ndynamic effect of inheritances on labor supply to vary among inheritor cohorts.\nThe estimation approach adopted and the 25-year long panel data make it\npossible to trace the dynamics of the effect for at least 20 years, which is\ntwice as long as the study period in previous studies. Since all observations\nin the sample are inheritors, I avoid the selection problem arising in studies\nemploying non-inheritors as controls. I find that large parental inheritances\n(more than one million Norwegian kroner) reduce annual wage and occupational\nincome by, at most, 4.3%, which is about half the decrease previously\nidentified. The magnitude of the effect increases with the size of the\ninheritance. Large inheritances also increase the probability of being\nself-employed by more than 1%, although entrepreneurship may be dampened by\ninheritances that are excessively large. The inheritance effect lasts for up to\n10 years and is heterogeneous across sexes and age groups. Male heirs are more\nlikely to reduce their labor supply after receiving the transfer. Young heirs\nare more likely to be self-employed, and their annual occupational income is,\ntherefore, less affected by inheritances in the long run; for the very young\ninheriting large amounts of wealth from their grandparents, the probability of\ntheir attaining a post-secondary education declines by 2%.",

Because the felt experience of quality of life\nis derived from a constellation of factors which make up the indivisible\nstructure of a milieu, the experience of quality of life cannot be regarded as\na subjective experience. Through the example of how different frequencies, and\nmixtures of frequencies, of light are perceived as colour by the eye, I\ndemonstrate that the human cognitive apparatus, because of its relation to the\nobject that is measured, apprehends different scales of quantity as degrees of\nquality.

Following an analysis of the ability of\ndifferent spectral bands and burn indices to separate burned and unburned plots\nindividually, we built a Random Forest model with those determined to provide\nthe greatest separability and evaluated model performance with ground-verified\ndata. Our overall model accuracy of 82-percent is favorable given the\nchallenges presented by the measurement.

        "abstract": "European Monetary Union continues to be characterised by significant\nmacroeconomic imbalances. Germany has shown increasing current account\nsurpluses at the expense of the other member states (especially the European\nperiphery). Since the creation of a single currency has implied the\nimpossibility of implementing competitive devaluations, trade imbalances within\na monetary union can be considered unfair behaviour. We have modelled Eurozone\ntrade flows in goods through a weighted network from 1995 to 2019. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first work that applies this methodology to this\nkind of data. Network analysis has allowed us to estimate a series of important\ncentrality measures. A polarisation phenomenon emerges in relation to the\ngrowth of German dominance. The common currency has then not been capable to\nremove trade asymmetry, increasing the distance between surplus and deficit\ncountries. This situation should be addressed with expansionary policies on the\ndemand side at national and supranational level.",

However, there is no comprehensive study that\naddresses contributions of AI in EL management. Therefore, the main goal of\nthis study was to address this theoretical gap and determine the contribution\nof AI models to EL. Methods: This study applied the PRISMA method, a systematic\nliterature review model, to ensure that the maximum number of publications\nrelated to the subject can be accessed. The output of the PRISMA model led to\nthe identification of 23 related articles, and the findings of this study were\npresented based on the analysis of these articles. Results: The findings\nrevealed that AL algorithms were used in all stages of EL management (i.e.,\nrecruitment, on-boarding, employability and benefits, retention, and\noff-boarding). It was also disclosed that Random Forest, Support Vector\nMachines, Adaptive Boosting, Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Network\nalgorithms outperform other algorithms and were the most used in the\nliterature. Conclusion: Although the use of AI models in solving EL problems is\nincreasing, research on this topic is still in its infancy stage, and more\nresearch on this topic is necessary.",

        "abstract": "In the backdrop of growing power transitions and rise of strategic high tide\nin the world, the Indo Pacific Region (IPR) has emanated as an area which is\nlikely to witness increased development & enhanced security cooperation through\nmilitarization. With China trying to be at the seat of the Global leadership,\nUS & its allies in the Indo pacific are aiming at working together, finding\nmutually beneficial areas of functional cooperation and redefining the canvas\nof security. This purpose of this paper is to analyze an informal alliance,\nQuadrilateral Security dialogue (QUAD) in its present form with the\ngeostrategic landscape in Indo pacific and present recommendations to\nstrengthen collaboration & response capability.",

        "title": "Integrated storage assignment for an e-grocery fulfilment centre: Accounting for day-of-week demand patterns",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we deal with a storage assignment problem arising in a\nfulfilment centre of a major European e-grocery retailer. The centre can be\ncharacterised as a hybrid warehouse consisting of a highly efficient and\npartially automated fast-picking area designed as a pick-and-pass system with\nmultiple stations, and a picker-to-parts area. The storage assignment problem\nconsidered in this paper comprises the decisions to select the products to be\nallocated to the fast-picking area, the assignment of the products to picking\nstations and the determination of a shelf within the assigned station. The\nobjective is to achieve a high level of picking efficiency while respecting\nstation workload balancing and precedence order constraints. We propose to\nsolve this three-level problem using an integrated MILP model. In computational\nexperiments with real-world data, we show that using the proposed integrated\napproach yields significantly better results than a sequential approach in\nwhich the selection of products to be included in the fast-picking area is\nsolved before assigning station and shelf. Furthermore, we provide an extension\nto the integrated storage assignment model that explicitly accounts for\nwithin-week demand variation. In a set of experiments with\nday-of-week-dependent demands we show that while a storage assignment that is\nbased on average demand figures tends to exhibit a highly imbalanced workload\non certain days of the week, the augmented model yields storage assignments\nthat are well balanced on each day of the week without compromising the quality\nof the solutions in terms of picking efficiency.",
