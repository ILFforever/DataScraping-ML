        "abstract": "We introduce the Coarse Payoff-Assessment Learning (CPAL) model, which\ncaptures reinforcement learning by boundedly rational decision-makers who focus\non the aggregate outcomes of choosing among exogenously defined clusters of\nalternatives (similarity classes), rather than evaluating each alternative\nindividually. Analyzing a smooth approximation of the model, we show that the\nlearning dynamics exhibit steady-states corresponding to smooth Valuation\nEquilibria (Jehiel and Samet, 2007). We demonstrate the existence of multiple\nequilibria in decision trees with generic payoffs and establish the local\nasymptotic stability of pure equilibria when they occur. Conversely, when\ntrivial choices featuring alternatives within the same similarity class yield\nsufficiently high payoffs, a unique mixed equilibrium emerges, characterized by\nindifferences between similarity classes, even under acute sensitivity to\npayoff differences. Finally, we prove that this unique mixed equilibrium is\nglobally asymptotically stable under the CPAL dynamics.",

        "abstract": "We propose a model of unawareness that remains close to the paradigm of\nAumann's model for knowledge [R. J. Aumann, International Journal of Game\nTheory 28 (1999) 263-300]: just as Aumann uses a correspondence on a state\nspace to define an agent's knowledge operator on events, we use a\ncorrespondence on a state space to define an agent's awareness operator on\nevents. This is made possible by three ideas. First, like the model of [A.\nHeifetz, M. Meier, and B. Schipper, Journal of Economic Theory 130 (2006)\n78-94], ours is based on a space of partial specifications of the world,\npartially ordered by a relation of further specification or refinement, and the\nidea that agents may be aware of some coarser-grained specifications while\nunaware of some finer-grained specifications; however, our model is based on a\ndifferent implementation of this idea, related to forcing in set theory.\nSecond, we depart from a tradition in the literature, initiated by [S. Modica\nand A. Rustichini, Theory and Decision 37 (1994) 107-124] and adopted by\nHeifetz et al. and [J. Li, Journal of Economic Theory 144 (2009) 977-993], of\ntaking awareness to be definable in terms of knowledge. Third, we show that the\nnegative conclusion of a well-known impossibility theorem concerning\nunawareness in [Dekel, Lipman, and Rustichini, Econometrica 66 (1998) 159-173]\ncan be escaped by a slight weakening of a key axiom. Together these points\ndemonstrate that a correspondence on a partial-state space is sufficient to\nmodel unawareness of events. Indeed, we prove a representation theorem showing\nthat any abstract Boolean algebra equipped with awareness, knowledge, and\nbelief operators satisfying some plausible axioms is representable as the\nalgebra of events arising from a partial-state space with awareness, knowledge,\nand belief correspondences.",

In problems with multi-dimensional types,\nevery exhaustive mechanism can be transformed into an extreme point by applying\nan arbitrarily small perturbation. For mechanisms with a finite menu, this\nperturbation displaces the menu items into general position. Generic exhaustive\nmechanisms are extreme points with an uncountable menu. Similar results hold in\napplications to delegation, veto bargaining, and monopoly problems, where we\nconsider mechanisms that are unique maximizers for specific classes of\nobjective functionals.

        "abstract": "A general theory of stochastic extensive forms is developed to bridge two\nconcepts of information flow: decision trees and refined partitions on the one\nside, filtrations from probability theory on the other. Instead of the\ntraditional \"nature\" agent, this framework uses a single lottery draw to select\na tree of a given decision forest. Each \"personal\" agent receives dynamic\nupdates from an own oracle on the lottery outcome and makes partition-refining\nchoices adapted to this information. This theory addresses a key limitation of\nexisting approaches in extensive form theory, which struggle to model\ncontinuous-time stochastic processes, such as Brownian motion, as outcomes of\n\"nature\" decision making. Additionally, a class of stochastic extensive forms\nbased on time-indexed action paths is constructed, encompassing a wide range of\nmodels from the literature and laying the groundwork for an approximation\ntheory for stochastic differential games in extensive form.",

Next, we propose a two-step procedure, inspired by\nOwen's procedure, to construct flow methods as above. Then, we show that the\nassociated flow is decomposable into two flows.

We tackle this problem while navigating a key sensitivity in\nthis domain: in foster care systems, individual caseworkers must assent to any\nproposed matching. We codify this constraint in one-sided matching markets as\nthe problem of matching design with sufficiency. We design a mechanism that\nguarantees outcome sufficiency, a form of welfare-maximizing Pareto efficiency\nensuring that no caseworker can ex-post gain from any child-family placement\nreassignment and that the foster care authority's objective preferences for\nchild-family placements are maximally satisfied. Our work subsequently\nevaluates this mechanism's strategic properties. Finally, we plan to conduct a\nlab-in-the-field experiment to elicit real-world caseworkers' preferences and\nestimate the child welfare gains our algorithm produces. Current\nsimulation-based results show dramatic improvements to welfare. Designing\nsufficient matching systems is an example of mechanism-reform because replacing\nexisting systems without regard for existing agents' preferences and wishes has\npreviously resulted in failure.",

Furthermore, the\nwelfare-relevance of the specific models established in the literature are much\nworse. The model with the highest welfare-relevance produces a revealed\npreference relation with the average density of 2% (1 out of 45 possible\ncomparisons revealed), while rational choice does 63% (28 out of 45 possible\ncomparisons).

The\nstrategies available to the traders have two dimensions: on the one hand, the\ntraders must endogenously choose whether to acquire a costly information\nsignal, on the other, they must determine how aggressively they trade by\nchoosing the share of their wealth to be invested in the risky asset. Our study\ncontributes to two strands of literature: the literature comparing the effects\nof competitive and strategic behavior on asset price efficiency under costly\ninformation as well as the actively growing literature on algorithmic tacit\ncollusion and pseudo-collusion in financial markets. We find that for certain\nmarket environments (with low information costs) our model reproduces the\nresults of Kyle [1989] in that the ability of traders to trade strategically\nleads to worse price efficiency compared to the purely competitive case. For\nother environments (with high information costs), on the other hand, our\nresults show that a market with strategically acting traders can be more\nefficient than a purely competitive one. Furthermore, we obtain novel results\non the ability of independently learning traders to coordinate on a\npseudo-collusive behavior, leading to non-competitive pricing. Contrary to some\nrecent contributions (see e.g. [Cartea et al. 2022]), we find that the\npseudo-collusive behavior in our model is robust to a large number of agents,\ndemonstrating that even in the setting of financial markets with a large number\nof independently learning traders non-competitive pricing and pseudo-collusive\nbehavior can frequently arise.",

This--seemingly simple--task has led to\na rich literature and has become well known in the context of the US House of\nRepresentatives. In this paper, we connect the design of monotone apportionment\nmethods to classic problems from discrete geometry and combinatorial\noptimization and explore the extent to which randomization can enhance\nproportionality.\n  We first focus on the well-studied family of stationary divisor methods,\nwhich satisfy the strong population monotonicity property, and show that this\nfamily produces only a slightly superlinear number of different outputs as a\nfunction of the number of states. While our upper and lower bounds leave a\nsmall gap, we show that--surprisingly--closing this gap would solve a\nlong-standing open problem from discrete geometry, known as the complexity of\n$k$-levels in line arrangements. The main downside of divisor methods is their\nviolation of the quota axiom, i.e., every state should receive $\\lfloor\nq_i\\rfloor$ or $\\lceil q_i\\rceil$ seats, where $q_i$ is the proportional share\nof the state. As we show that randomizing over divisor methods can only\npartially overcome this issue, we propose a relaxed version of divisor methods\nin which the total number of seats may slightly deviate from the house size. By\nrandomizing over them, we can simultaneously satisfy population monotonicity,\nquota, and ex-ante proportionality.\n  Finally, we turn our attention to quota-compliant methods that are\nhouse-monotone, i.e., no state may lose a seat when the house size is\nincreased. We provide a polyhedral characterization based on network flows,\nwhich implies a simple description of all ex-ante proportional randomized\nmethods that are house-monotone and quota-compliant.",

This notion can be shown to be equivalent to\na regular garbling conditional on some event for the former experiment. We also\ncharacterize this order in terms of posterior beliefs and show that it only\ndepends on the support of posterior beliefs, not their distribution. Our main\nresults are two characterizations of the weighted-garbling order based on some\ndecision problems. For static Bayesian decision problems, one experiment is\nmore informative than another in the weighted-garbling order if and only if a\ndecision maker's value of information (i.e., the difference in the optimal\nexpected payoffs with and without an experiment) from the former is guaranteed\nto be some fraction of the value of information from the latter for any\ndecision problem. When the weighted garbling is a regular garbling, this lower\nbound reduces to the value of information itself as the fraction becomes one,\nthus generalizing the result in Blackwell (1951, 1953). We also consider a\nclass of stopping time problems where the state of nature changes over time\naccording to a hidden Markov process, and a patient decision maker can conduct\nthe same experiment as many times as she wants without any cost before making a\none-time decision.

        "abstract": "Two office-driven politicians compete in an election by proposing policies.\nThere are two possible states of the world: climate change is either mild, with\nno lasting effect on welfare if addressed properly, or severe, leading to\nreduced welfare even with appropriate measures. Voters receive signals about\nthe state but may interpret them in a non-Bayesian way, holding motivated\nbeliefs. An equilibrium always exists where voters ignore signals suggesting\nsevere consequences, causing politicians to propose policies for mild climate\nchange -- even when they know otherwise. If severe climate change leads to only\nmoderate welfare losses, another efficient equilibrium exists. In this\nequilibrium, voters trust politicians to choose the optimal policies, implying\nvoters choose to trust their signals, which in turn encourages optimal policy\nchoices by politicians. The model highlights the role of political rhetoric and\ntrust in government, and a first glance at the data reveals patterns consistent\nwith the models predictions.",

Our global analysis reveals that increasing transition\nrisk, e.g., by threatening to impose stricter environmental regulations,\neffectively incentivizes the green transition. Economic policy recommendations\nderived from our model further suggest maintaining high transition risk\nregardless of the industry's level of greenness. Subsidizing the costs of\nadopting green technologies can reduce the risk of a failed green transition.\nWhile advances in green technologies can amplify the effects of green policies,\nthey do not completely eliminate the possibility of a failed green transition.\nFinally, evolutionary pressures favor the green transition when green\ntechnologies are profitable.",

Under single-item selection, the\ndecision maker must select one item; under combinatorial selection, the\ndecision maker must select a set of items that satisfies certain constraints.\nIn our nonobligatory inspection setting, the decision maker can select items\nwithout first inspecting them. It is well-known that search with nonobligatory\ninspection is harder than the well-studied obligatory inspection case, for\nwhich the optimal policy for single-item selection (Weitzman, 1979) and\napproximation algorithms for combinatorial selection (Singla, 2018) are known.\n  We introduce a technique, local hedging, for constructing policies with good\napproximation ratios in the nonobligatory inspection setting. Local hedging\ntransforms policies for the obligatory inspection setting into policies for the\nnonobligatory inspection setting, at the cost of an extra factor in the\napproximation ratio.

Moreover, suppose the\nprincipal can observe the agents' decisions and the outcomes of these\ndecisions. The goal is to design a communication and recommendation policy\nwhich (i) achieves a desirable balance between exploration and exploitation,\nand (ii) incentivizes the agents to follow recommendations.

It is essential that the principal\ndoes not fully reveal all its knowledge to the agents.\n  Incentivized exploration combines two important problems in, resp., machine\nlearning and theoretical economics. First, if agents always follow\nrecommendations, the principal faces a multi-armed bandit problem: essentially,\ndesign an algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation.

The complexity of price formation in the power system arises from\nits diverse attributes, such as various generator types, each characterized by\nits specific fixed and variable costs as well as different lifetimes. In this\npaper, we adopt an approach that investigates both long-run marginal cost\n(LRMC) and short-run marginal cost (SRMC) in a perfect competition market.\nAccording to economic theory, marginal pricing serves as an effective method\nfor determining the generation cost of electricity. This paper presents a\ncapacity expansion model designed to evaluate the marginal cost of electricity\ngeneration, encompassing both long-term and short-term perspectives. Following\na parametric analysis and the calculation of LRMCs, this study investigates the\nallocation of investment costs across various time periods and how these costs\nfactor into the LRMC to ensure cost recovery. Additionally, an exploration of\nSRMCs reveals the conditions under which LRMCs and SRMCs converge or diverge.\nWe observe that when there is a disparity between LRMC and SRMC, setting\nelectricity generation prices equal to SRMCs does not ensure the complete\nrecovery of investment and operational costs. This phenomenon holds\nimplications for market reliability and challenges the pricing strategies that\nrely solely on SRMCs. Furthermore, our investigation highlighted the\nsignificance of addressing degeneracy in the power market modeling. Primal\ndegeneracy in the SRMC model can result in multiple values for the dual\nvariable representing SRMC. This multiplicity of values creates ambiguity\nregarding the precise SRMC value, making it challenging to ascertain the\ncorrect estimation. As a result, resolving degeneracy will ensure the\nreliability of the SRMC value, consequently enhancing the robustness and\ncredibility of our analysis.",

The opposite implication does not, in general, hold and leads to\nquestions about intersections of cores of two games and their relations.\nFinally, we present an application of the SSD-core to the multiple newsvendors\nproblem, where we provide a characterization of risk averse behaviour of\nplayers with an interpretation in terms of the model.",

        "abstract": "We consider a retailer running a switchback experiment for the price of a\nsingle product, with infinite supply. In each period, the seller chooses a\nprice $p$ from a set of predefined prices that consist of a reference price and\na few discounted price levels. The goal is to estimate the demand gradient at\nthe reference price point, with the goal of adjusting the reference price to\nimprove revenue after the experiment. In our model, in each period, a unit mass\nof buyers arrives on the market, with values distributed based on a\ntime-varying process. Crucially, buyers are forward looking with a discounted\nutility and will choose to not purchase now if they expect to face a discounted\nprice in the near future. We show that forward-looking demand introduces bias\nin naive estimators of the demand gradient, due to intertemporal interference.\nFurthermore, we prove that there is no estimator that uses data from price\nexperiments with only two price points that can recover the correct demand\ngradient, even in the limit of an infinitely long experiment with an\ninfinitesimal price discount. Moreover, we characterize the form of the bias of\nnaive estimators. Finally, we show that with a simple three price level\nexperiment, the seller can remove the bias due to strategic forward-looking\nbehavior and construct an estimator for the demand gradient that asymptotically\nrecovers the truth.",

Despite its substantial benefits,\nthe free-riding behavior raises a major challenge for the formation of FL,\nespecially in competitive markets. Our paper explores this under-explored issue\non how the free-riding behavior in a competitive market affects firms'\nincentives to form FL. Competing firms can improve technologies through forming\nFL to increase the performance of their products, which in turn, affects\nconsumers' product selection and market size. The key complication is whether\nthe free-riding behavior discourages information contribution by participating\nfirms and results in the decomposition of FL, and even free riding does not\ndiscourage information contribution, this does not necessarily mean that a firm\nwants to form FL in a competitive market because free riding may reshape the\ncompetition positions of each participating firm and thus forming FL may not be\nprofitable. We build a parsimonious game theoretical model that captures these\ninteractions and our analyses show several new findings. First, even in the\npresence of the free-riding behavior, competing firms under FL find it optimal\nto contribute all its available information. Second, the firm with less amount\nof information always finds it profitable to free ride; whether its rival (with\nmore amount of information) have an incentive to form FL only when the level of\ncompetition or when the gap in information volume is not high. Third, when FL\nis formed, there exists an \"All-Win\" situation in which all stakeholders\n(participating firms, consumers, and social planner) benefit. Last, subsidizing\nby the free-riding firm can align its rival's incentive to form FL only when\nthe level of competition is intermediate.",

In the case of i.i.d. and\nregular valuations for the buyers, Board and Skrzypacz (2016) characterized the\noptimal mechanism and proved the optimality of posted prices in the\ncontinuous-time limit. Our main result considers the limit case of a continuum\nof buyers, establishing that for arbitrary independent buyers' valuations,\nposted prices and capacity rationing can implement the optimal anonymous\nmechanism. Our result departs from the literature in three ways: It does not\nmake any regularity assumptions, it considers the case of general, not\nnecessarily i.i.d., arrivals, and finally, not only posted prices but also\ncapacity rationing takes part in the optimal mechanism. Additionally, if supply\nis unlimited, we show that the rationing effect vanishes, and the optimal\nmechanism can be implemented using posted prices only, \\`a la Board (2008).",

Yet, as observed in this paper, the proof of the\ndifficult direction of this equivalence is unsatisfactory: It does not assign\ndistinct roles to the two players of the game, as is natural from the\ndefinition of a zero-sum game.\n  In retrospect, a partial resolution to this predicament was provided in\nanother brilliant paper of von Neumann (1953), which reduced the assignment\nproblem to zero-sum games. However, the underlying LP is highly specialized;\nall entries of its objective function vector are strictly positive and all\nentries of the constraint matrix and right hand side vector are equal to one.\n  We generalize von Neumann's result along two directions, each allowing\nnegative entries in certain parts of the LP. Our reductions make explicit the\nroles of the two players of the reduced game, namely their maximin strategies\nare to play optimal solutions to the primal and dual LPs. Furthermore, unlike\nprevious reductions, the value of the reduced game reveals the value of the\ngiven LP.

While the\npreviously-highlighted EIP-1559 is the gold-standard according to prior\ndesiderata, we show that it does not satisfy off-chain influence proofness.\nIntuitively, this holds because a Bayesian revenue-maximizing miner can\nstrictly increase profits by persuasively threatening to censor any bids that\ndo not transfer a tip directly to the miner off-chain.\n  On the other hand, we reconsider the Cryptographic (multi-party computation\nassisted) Second Price Auction mechanism, which is technically not `simple for\nminers' according to previous desiderata (since miners may wish to set a\nreserve by fabricating bids). We show that, in a slightly different model where\nthe miner is allowed to set the reserve directly, this auction satisfies\nsimplicity for users and miners, and off-chain influence proofness.\n  Finally, we prove a strong impossibility result: no mechanism satisfies all\npreviously-considered properties along with off-chain influence proofness, even\nwith unlimited supply, and even after soliciting input from the miner.",

We analyze the impact of search prominence\non firm profitability in a duopoly search model, considering the presence of\ncostly product returns. Consumer match values are assumed to be independently\nand identically distributed across the two products. Our results show that the\nnon-prominent firm benefits from facing consumers with relatively low match\nvalues for the prominent firm's products, thus avoiding costly returns. When\nreturn costs are sufficiently high, the prominent firm may earn lower profits\nthan its non-prominent competitor. This outcome holds under both price\nexogeneity and price competition. Furthermore, the profitability advantage of\nprominence diminishes as return costs increase.

This paper explores optimal information acquisition\nstrategies for direct online lenders, addressing the broader question: Should a\ndecision-maker rely on multiple lean experiments or opt for a single grand\nexperiment? We first examine a model where an online lender issuing unsecured\nloans maximizes its expected NPV at an exogenous interest rate, finding that a\nlean experimentation strategy is optimal. However, when the interest rate is\nendogenous, the choice between lean and grand experimentation depends on the\ndemand elasticity. If elasticity is increasing or constant, the lender prefers\na grand experiment, offering the same loan terms in each period. We also\nanalyze consumer segmentation and demonstrate how higher income variability\nbenefits the lender through more effective experimentation. In addition, we\ninvestigate hybrid information architectures that combine dynamic\nexperimentation with traditional static models. Our results show that the\nhybrid architecture enhances lender profitability, offering a flexible approach\nthat integrates sequential learning with static information.

As for the complexity lower bound, we prove that even computing\nverifications for most equitable rules is GI-complete (i.e., as hard as the\ngraph isomorphism problem), and sometimes GA-complete (i.e., as hard as the\ngraph automorphism problem), for many commonly studied combinations of\npreferences and decisions.

In the\nlast decades, demographic aspects beyond political support have been\nincorporated by requiring that they are also fairly represented in the body,\ngiving rise to a multidimensional version of the apportionment problem. In this\nwork, we provide an axiomatic justification for a recently proposed notion of\nmultidimensional proportionality and extend it to encompass two relevant\nconstraints often used in electoral systems: a threshold on the number of votes\nthat a list needs in order to be eligible and the election of the most-voted\ncandidate in each district.

Within societal settings, one example is participatory\nbudgeting, where constituents decide on the funding of public projects. How to\nmost efficiently aggregate diverse stakeholder inputs on a portfolio of\nprojects with uncertain long-term benefits remains an open question. We address\nthis problem by studying collective decision-making through the integration of\npreference aggregation and knapsack allocation methods. Since different\nstakeholder groups may evaluate projects differently,we examine several\naggregation methods that combine their diverse inputs. The aggregated\nevaluations are then used to fill a ``collective'' knapsack. Among the methods\nwe consider are the arithmetic mean, Borda-type rankings, and delegation to\nexperts. We find that the factors improving an aggregation method's ability to\nidentify projects with the greatest expected long-term value include having\nmany stakeholder groups, moderate variation in their expertise levels, and some\ndegree of delegation or bias favoring groups better positioned to objectively\nassess the projects. We also discuss how evaluation errors and heterogeneous\ncosts impact project selection. Our proposed aggregation methods are relevant\nnot only in the context of funding public projects but also, more generally,\nfor organizational decision-making under uncertainty.",

Utilizing\nsimulations from a behavioral New Keynesian model alongside real-world data\nderived from Federal Reserve speeches, the study employs an Auto-Regressive\nDistributed Lag (ARDL) technique to analyze the interplay between these\nfactors. The findings indicate that while the fraction of inflation\nextrapolators do not significantly affect the Fed's sentiment index, various\naspects of animal spirits exert a notable impact. This suggests that not only\nis the US output gap influenced by animal spirits, but the Federal Reserve's\ncommunication is also substantially shaped by these behavioral factors.

        "title": "Algorithmic Collusion Without Threats",
        "abstract": "There has been substantial recent concern that pricing algorithms might learn\nto ``collude.'' Supra-competitive prices can emerge as a Nash equilibrium of\nrepeated pricing games, in which sellers play strategies which threaten to\npunish their competitors who refuse to support high prices, and these\nstrategies can be automatically learned. In fact, a standard economic intuition\nis that supra-competitive prices emerge from either the use of threats, or a\nfailure of one party to optimize their payoff. Is this intuition correct? Would\npreventing threats in algorithmic decision-making prevent supra-competitive\nprices when sellers are optimizing for their own revenue? No. We show that\nsupra-competitive prices can emerge even when both players are using algorithms\nwhich do not encode threats, and which optimize for their own revenue. We study\nsequential pricing games in which a first mover deploys an algorithm and then a\nsecond mover optimizes within the resulting environment. We show that if the\nfirst mover deploys any algorithm with a no-regret guarantee, and then the\nsecond mover even approximately optimizes within this now static environment,\nmonopoly-like prices arise. The result holds for any no-regret learning\nalgorithm deployed by the first mover and for any pricing policy of the second\nmover that obtains them profit at least as high as a random pricing would --\nand hence the result applies even when the second mover is optimizing only\nwithin a space of non-responsive pricing distributions which are incapable of\nencoding threats. In fact, there exists a set of strategies, neither of which\nexplicitly encode threats that form a Nash equilibrium of the simultaneous\npricing game in algorithm space, and lead to near monopoly prices. This\nsuggests that the definition of ``algorithmic collusion'' may need to be\nexpanded, to include strategies without explicitly encoded threats.",

First, we\nshow that in a general class of symmetric games, including Prisoner's Dilemma,\nBertrand competition, and any (nonlinear) mixture of first and second price\nauction, only (strict) Nash Equilibrium (NE) is stochastically stable.\nTherefore, the tacit collusion is driven by failure to learn NE due to\ninsufficient learning, instead of learning some strategies to sustain collusive\noutcomes. Second, we study how algorithms adapt to collusion in real\nsimulations with insufficient learning. Extensive explorations in early stages\nand discount factors inflates the Q-value, which interrupts the sequential and\nalternative price undercut and leads to bilateral rebound. The process is\niterated, making the price curves like Edgeworth cycles. When both exploration\nrate and Q-value decrease, algorithms may bilaterally rebound to relatively\nhigh common price level by coincidence, and then get stuck. Finally, we\naccommodate our reasoning to simulation outcomes in the literature, including\noptimistic initialization, market design and algorithm design.",

We show that learning robust mechanisms -- those which\ndeliver the highest payoff guarantee across all learning processes -- are\nsimple and resemble `regulatory sandboxes' consisting of zero marginal tax on\nR&D which keeps the agent maximally sensitive to new information up to a hard\nquota, upon which the agent turns maximally insensitive. Robustness is\nimportant: we characterize the worst-case learning process under non-robust\nmechanisms and show that they induce growing but weak optimism which can\ndeliver unboundedly poor principal payoffs; hard quotas safeguard against this.\nIf the regulator also learns, adaptive hard quotas are robustly optimal which\nhighlights the importance of expertise in regulation.",

When agents make endogenous investment\ndecisions, there is a commitment problem. Ex-post, the elite face strong\nincentives to expropriate investments from the non-elite (who don't have\nproperty rights), which dissuades investment. Extending property rights to new\ngroups can resolve this problem, even for those not given property rights, by\nmaking public good provision more attractive to the elite. Unlike other models\nof franchise extensions, extending property rights in this paper does not\ninvolve the elite ceding control to others. Rather, it changes the incentives\nthey face. Additionally, adding identity groups to the model shows that an\nelite faces weaker incentives to resolve the commitment problem when it is part\nof a minority identity -- identity fragmentation makes it harder for a society\nto extend property rights.",

We study a Bayesian\npersuasion interaction between a sender and a receiver where the sender has\naccess to private information and the receiver attempts to recover this\ninformation from messages sent by the sender. The sender crafts these messages\nin an attempt to maximize its utility which depends on the source symbol and\nthe symbol recovered by the receiver.

These constraints encode that any signal in\na persuasion strategy must contain more truth than untruth and thus impose a\nfundamental bound on the extent of obfuscation a sender can perform. We define\n\\textit{informativeness} of the sender as the minimum expected number of\nsymbols truthfully revealed by the sender in any accumulation point of a\nsequence of $\\varepsilon$-equilibrium persuasion strategies, and show that it\nis given by another linear program. Informativeness is a fundamental bound on\nthe amount of information the sender must reveal to persuade a receiver.

An insightful and significant result in robust mechanism design\nliterature is that if the seller knows only marginal distributions of the\nbuyer's valuation, then separable mechanisms, in which all items are sold\nindependently, are robustly optimal under the maximin revenue objectives. While\nthe separable mechanism is simple to implement, the literature also indicates\nthat separate selling can not guarantee any substantial fraction of the\npotential optimal revenue for given distributions. To design a simple mechanism\nwith a good performance guarantee, we introduce a novel class of mechanisms,\ntermed \"semi-separable mechanism\". In these mechanisms, the allocation and\npayment rule of each item is a function solely of the corresponding item's\nvaluation, which retains the separable mechanism's practical simplicity.\nHowever, the design of the allocation and payment function is enhanced by\nleveraging the joint distributional information, thereby improving the\nperformance guarantee against the hindsight optimal revenue. We establish that\na semi-separable mechanism achieves the optimal performance ratio among all\nincentive-compatible and individually rational mechanisms when only marginal\nsupport information is known. This result demonstrates that the semi-separable\nmechanisms ensure both the interpretation and implementation simplicity, and\nperformance superiority. Our framework is also applicable to scenarios where\nthe seller possesses information about the aggregate valuations of product\nbundles within any given partition of the product set. Furthermore, our results\nalso provide guidelines for the multi-item screening problem with non-standard\nambiguity sets.",

Specifically, the auction\nis rank-guaranteed, meaning that for any menu M and any valuation profile, the\nex-post revenue is guaranteed to be at least as high as the highest revenue\nachievable from feasible allocations, taking the (|M|+ 1)th-highest valuation\nfor each bundle as the price. Our analysis highlights a crucial aspect of\ncombinatorial auction design, namely, the design of menus. We provide simple\nand approximately optimal menus in various settings.",

        "abstract": "In practice, most auction mechanisms are not strategy-proof, so equilibrium\nanalysis is required to predict bidding behavior. In many auctions, though, an\nexact equilibrium is not known and one would like to understand whether --\nmanually or computationally generated -- bidding strategies constitute an\napproximate equilibrium. We develop a framework and methods for estimating the\ndistance of a strategy profile from equilibrium, based on samples from the\nprior and either bidding strategies or sample bids. We estimate an agent's\nutility gain from deviating to strategies from a constructed finite subset of\nthe strategy space. We use PAC-learning to give error bounds, both for\nindependent and interdependent prior distributions. The primary challenge is\nthat one may miss large utility gains by considering only a finite subset of\nthe strategy space. Our work differs from prior research in two critical ways.\nFirst, we explore the impact of bidding strategies on altering opponents'\nperceived prior distributions -- instead of assuming the other agents to bid\ntruthfully. Second, we delve into reasoning with interdependent priors, where\nthe type of one agent may imply a distinct distribution for other agents. Our\nmain contribution lies in establishing sufficient conditions for strategy\nprofiles and a closeness criterion for conditional distributions to ensure that\nutility gains estimated through our finite subset closely approximate the\nmaximum gains. To our knowledge, ours is the first method to verify approximate\nequilibrium in any auctions beyond single-item ones. Also, ours is the first\nsample-based method for approximate equilibrium verification.",

Traditionally, they involve the sequential observation of $n$\nnon-negative independent random variables and face irrevocable accept-or-reject\nchoices. The goal is to provide policies that provide a good approximation\nratio against the optimal offline solution that can access all the values\nupfront -- the so-called prophet value. In the prophet inequality over time\nproblem (POT), the decision-maker can commit to an accepted value for $\\tau$\nunits of time, during which no new values can be accepted. This creates a\ntrade-off between the duration of commitment and the opportunity to capture\npotentially higher future values.\n  In this work, we provide best possible worst-case approximation ratios in the\nIID setting of POT for single-threshold algorithms and the optimal dynamic\nprogramming policy. We show a single-threshold algorithm that achieves an\napproximation ratio of $(1+e^{-2})/2\\approx 0.567$, and we prove that no\nsingle-threshold algorithm can surpass this guarantee. With our techniques, we\ncan analyze simple algorithms using $k$ thresholds and show that with $k=3$ it\nis possible to get an approximation ratio larger than $\\approx 0.602$. Then,\nfor each $n$, we prove it is possible to compute the tight worst-case\napproximation ratio of the optimal dynamic programming policy for instances\nwith $n$ values by solving a convex optimization program. A limit analysis of\nthe first-order optimality conditions yields a nonlinear differential equation\nshowing that the optimal dynamic programming policy's asymptotic worst-case\napproximation ratio is $\\approx 0.618$. Finally, we extend the discussion to\nadversarial settings and show an optimal worst-case approximation ratio of\n$\\approx 0.162$ when the values are streamed in random order.",

Here we explore a simple mechanism to sustain an institution\nof reputational judgment: a compulsory contribution from each member of the\npopulation, i.e., a tax. We analyze the maximum possible tax rate that\nindividuals will rationally pay to sustain an institution of judgment, which\nprovides a public good in the form of information, and we derive necessary\nconditions for individuals to resist the temptation to evade their tax payment.\nWe also consider the possibility that institution members may be corrupt and\nsubject to bribery, and we analyze how often an institution must be audited to\nprevent bribery.

We provide general tools to\ncharacterize the convergence rate between the optimal mechanism for the central\nplanner and the first-best allocation if true agent utilities were available.\nThis heavily depends on the utility distributions, yielding rates anywhere\nbetween $1/\\sqrt T$ and $1/T$ for the finite-horizon setting, and rates faster\nthan $\\sqrt{1-\\gamma}$, including exponential rates for the infinite-horizon\nsetting as agents are more patient $\\gamma\\to 1$.

Intuitively, the\nmore flexibility the central planner has to reward or penalize any agent while\nincurring little social welfare cost, the faster the convergence rate.

        "abstract": "Throughout history, many countries have repeatedly experienced large swings\nin asset prices, which are usually accompanied by large fluctuations in\nmacroeconomic activity. One of the characteristics of the period before major\neconomic fluctuations is the emergence of new financial products; the situation\nprior to the 2008 financial crisis is a prominent example of this. During that\nperiod, a variety of structured bonds, including securitized products,\nappeared. Because of the high returns on such financial products, many economic\nagents were involved in them for speculative purposes, even if they were\nriskier, producing macro-scale effects.\n  With this motivation, we present a simple macroeconomic model with financial\nspeculation. Our model illustrates two points. First, stochastic fluctuations\nin asset prices and macroeconomic activity are driven by the repeated\nappearance and disappearance of risky financial assets, rather than expansions\nand contractions in credit availability. Second, in an economy with sufficient\nborrowing and lending, the appearance of risky financial assets leads to\ndecreased productive capital, while in an economy with severely limited\nborrowing and lending, it leads to increased productive capital.",

        "abstract": "In dynamic programming and reinforcement learning, the policy for the\nsequential decision making of an agent in a stochastic environment is usually\ndetermined by expressing the goal as a scalar reward function and seeking a\npolicy that maximizes the expected total reward. However, many goals that\nhumans care about naturally concern multiple aspects of the world, and it may\nnot be obvious how to condense those into a single reward function.\nFurthermore, maximization suffers from specification gaming, where the obtained\npolicy achieves a high expected total reward in an unintended way, often taking\nextreme or nonsensical actions.\n  Here we consider finite acyclic Markov Decision Processes with multiple\ndistinct evaluation metrics, which do not necessarily represent quantities that\nthe user wants to be maximized. We assume the task of the agent is to ensure\nthat the vector of expected totals of the evaluation metrics falls into some\ngiven convex set, called the aspiration set. Our algorithm guarantees that this\ntask is fulfilled by using simplices to approximate feasibility sets and\npropagate aspirations forward while ensuring they remain feasible. It has\ncomplexity linear in the number of possible state-action-successor triples and\npolynomial in the number of evaluation metrics. Moreover, the explicitly\nnon-maximizing nature of the chosen policy and goals yields additional degrees\nof freedom, which can be used to apply heuristic safety criteria to the choice\nof actions. We discuss several such safety criteria that aim to steer the agent\ntowards more conservative behavior.",

We\nstudy a model where bidders compete in an execution auction ahead of time, and\nthen the winner holds a JIT auction to resell the proposal rights when the slot\narrives. During the execution auction, bidders only know the distribution of\ntheir valuations. Bidders then draw values from their distributions and compete\nin the JIT auction. We show that a bidder who wins the execution auction is\nsubstantially advantaged in the JIT auction since they can set a reserve price\nhigher than their own realized value for the slot to increase their revenue. As\na result, there is a strong centralizing force in the execution auction, which\nallows the ex-ante strongest bidder to win the execution auction every time,\nand similarly gives them the strongest incentive to buy up all the tickets.\nSimilar results trivially apply if the resale market is imperfect, since that\nonly reinforces the advantages of the ex-ante strong buyer.

This provides a sequential solution to the\nbargaining problem, and it can be implemented iteratively reaching well-defined\noutcomes. The solution is Pareto-optimal, symmetric, and is invariant to\naffine-transformations of utilities. For susceptible players, iterations are\nunnecessary, so they converge in one stage toward the (axiomatic) Nash solution\nof the bargaining problem.

Thus the Nash solution is reached without external arbiters and\nwithout requiring the independence of irrelevant alternatives.

Without commitment or costly signaling, market failure\ncan occur. Certification intermediaries reduce these frictions by enabling\nsignaling through hard information. This paper focuses on a monopolistic\ncertifier and its impact on equilibrium welfare and certificate design. Key\nfindings show that the certifier provides minimal information, pooling senders\nof varying abilities and leaving low rents for high type senders, which\ntypically disadvantages the receiver. However, when precise information is\ndemanded, the certifier screens the sender perfectly, benefiting the receiver.\nThus, the monopolistic intermediary has an ambiguous effect on market\nefficiency. The results emphasize the importance of high certification\nstandards, which drive low ability senders out of the market. Conditions for\nsuch equilibria are characterized, showing how simple threshold strategies by\nthe receiver induce first-best outcomes. Additionally, the relationship between\nthe characteristics of offered certificates and welfare is identified.",

Is it reasonable to anticipate that,\nin these circumstances, cooperation will emerge? This paper addresses this\nquestion by examining the emergence of cooperative behaviour, in the presence\nof \\textit{noise} (or, under \\textit{selection pressure}), in repeated\nPrisoner's Dilemma games, involving strategies such as \\textit{Tit-for-Tat},\n\\textit{Always Defect}, \\textit{GRIM}, \\textit{Win-Stay, Lose-Shift}, and\nothers. To analyze these games, we employ a numerical Agent-Based Model (ABM)\nand compare it with the analytical Nash Equilibrium Mapping (NEM) technique,\nboth based on the \\textit{1D}-Ising chain. We use \\textit{game magnetization}\nas an indicator of cooperative behaviour. A significant finding is that for\nsome repeated games, a discontinuity in the game magnetization indicates a\n\\textit{first}-order \\textit{selection pressure/noise}-driven phase transition.\nThe phase transition is particular to strategies where players do not severely\npunish a single defection. We also observe that in these particular cases, the\nphase transition critically depends on the number of \\textit{rounds} the game\nis played in the thermodynamic limit. For all five games, we find that both ABM\nand NEM, in conjunction with game magnetization, provide crucial inputs on how\ncooperative behaviour can emerge in an infinite-player repeated Prisoner's\ndilemma game.",

We establish that, in a 2-regular topology, when the\nvalues of fields are close enough and the number of players is not a multiple\nof 4, then there is a unique equilbrium.

Players are divided into skill-based tiers, based on their Elo ratings.\n  2. Starting with one or more mini-tournaments of the least skilled players\n(Tier 1), the winner or winners -- after playing multiple opponents -- move to\nthe next-higher tier.\n  3. The winners progress to a final tier of the best-performing players from\nlower tiers as well as players with the highest Elo ratings.\n  4. Performance in each tier is given by a player's Tournament Score (TS),\nwhich depends on his/her wins, losses, and draws (not on his/her Elo rating).\n  Whereas a player's Elo rating determines in which mini-tournament he/she\nstarts play, TS and its associated tie-breaking rules determine whether a\nplayer moves up to higher tiers and, in the final mini-tournament, wins the\ntournament. This combination of players' past Elo ratings and current TS's\nprovides a fair and accurate measure of a player's standing among the players\nin the tournament. We apply a variation of Multi-Tier Tournaments to the top 20\nactive chess players in the world (as of February 2024). Using a dataset of\n1209 head-to-head games, we illustrate the viability of giving lower-rated\nplayers the opportunity to progress and challenge higher-rated players. We also\nbriefly discuss the application of Multi-Tier Tournaments to baseball, soccer,\nand other sports that emphasize physical rather than mental skills.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel measurement of informational size to school\nchoice problems, which inherits its ideas from Mount and Reiter (1974). This\nconcept measures a matching mechanism's information size by counting the\nmaximal relevant preference and priority rankings to secure a certain pairwise\nassignment of a student to a school across all possible matching problems. Our\nanalysis uncovers two key insights. First, the three prominent strategy-proof\nmatching mechanisms, the deferred acceptance (DA) mechanism, the top trading\ncycles (TTC) mechanism, and the serial dictatorship (SD) mechanism, is\n(strictly) less informative than the non-strategy-proof immediate acceptance\n(IA) mechanism. This result highlights a previously omitted advantage of IA in\nterm of its information demand, which partially explain the its popularity in\nreal-world matching problems especially when acquiring information is both\npecuniarily and cognitively costly. Second, when the matching problem contains\nat least four students, the TTC demands less information compared to the DA to\nimplement a desired allocation. The issue of comparison between TTC and DA has\npuzzled researchers both in theory (Gonczarowski and Thomas, 2023) and in\nexperiment (Hakimov and Kubler, 2021). Our result responds to this issue from\nan informational perspective: in experiments with relatively fewer students,\nagents tend to prefer DA over TTC as DA requires fewer information to secure\none's allocation in all problems (Guillen and Veszteg, 2021), while the\nopposite is true when the market size increases (Pais et al., 2011). Among\nothers, our informational size concept offers a new perspective to understand\nthe differences in auditability (Grigoryan and Moller, 2024), manipulation\nvulnerability (Pathak and Sonmez, 2013), and privacy protection (Haupt and\nHitzig, 2022), among some commonly used matching mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "I study the optimal design of ratings to motivate agent investment in quality\nwhen transfers are unavailable. The principal designs a rating scheme that maps\nthe agent's quality to a (possibly stochastic) score. The agent has private\ninformation about his ability, which determines his cost of investment, and\nchooses the quality level. The market observes the score and offers a wage\nequal to the agent's expected quality. For example, a school incentivizes\nlearning through a grading policy that discloses the student's quality to the\njob market.\n  I reduce the principal's problem to the design of an interim wage function of\nquality. When restricted to deterministic ratings, I provide necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the optimality of simple pass/fail tests and lower\ncensorship. In particular, when the principal's objective is expected quality,\npass/fail tests are optimal if agents' abilities are concentrated towards the\ntop of the distribution, while pass/lower censorship is optimal if abilities\nare concentrated towards the mode. The results generalize existing results in\noptimal delegation with voluntary participation, as pass/fail tests (lower\ncensorship) correspond to take-it-or-leave-it offers (threshold delegation).\nAdditionally, I provide sufficient conditions for deterministic ratings to\nremain optimal when stochastic ratings are allowed. For quality maximization,\npass/fail tests remain optimal if the ability distribution becomes increasingly\nmore concentrated towards the top.",

We discuss how these analytic results\nprovide a deep and intuitive understanding into the disease dynamics, useful\nfor both individuals and policymakers.

Consider this scenario: A\ngroup of individuals wants to choose an option from a set of alternatives\nwithout requiring an identification or proof-of-personhood system. Moreover,\nthey want to implement utilitarianism as their selection criteria. In such a\ncase, players could submit votes multiple times using dummy accounts, commonly\nknown as a Sybil attack (SA), which presents a challenge for decentralized\norganizations. Is there a voting mechanism that always prevents players from\nbenefiting by casting votes multiple times (SA-proof) while also selecting the\nalternative that maximizes the added valuations of all players (efficient)?\nOne-person-one-vote is neither SA-proof nor efficient. Coin voting is SA-proof\nbut not efficient. Quadratic voting is efficient but not SA-proof. This study\nuses Bayesian mechanism design to propose a solution. The mechanism's structure\nis as follows: Players make wealth deposits to indicate the strength of their\npreference for each alternative. Each player then receives an amount based on\ntheir deposit and the voting outcome. The proposed mechanism relies on two main\nconcepts: 1) Transfers are influenced by the outcome in a way that each\nplayer's optimal action depends only on individual preferences and the number\nof alternatives; 2) A player who votes through multiple accounts slightly\nreduces the expected utility of all players more than the individual benefit\ngained. This study demonstrates that if players are risk-neutral and each\nplayer has private information about their preferences and beliefs, then the\nmechanism is SA-proof and efficient.

        "abstract": "Electric power systems are undergoing a major transformation as they\nintegrate intermittent renewable energy sources, and batteries to smooth out\nvariations in renewable energy production. As privately-owned batteries grow\nfrom their role as marginal \"price-takers\" to significant players in the\nmarket, a natural question arises: How do batteries operate in electricity\nmarkets, and how does the strategic behavior of decentralized batteries distort\ndecisions compared to centralized batteries?\n  We propose an analytically tractable model that captures salient features of\nthe highly complex electricity market. We derive in closed form the resulting\nbattery behavior and generation cost in three operating regimes: (i) no\nbattery, (ii) centralized battery, and (ii) decentralized profit-maximizing\nbattery. We establish that a decentralized battery distorts its discharge\ndecisions in three ways. First, there is quantity withholding, i.e.,\ndischarging less than centrally optimal. Second, there is a shift in\nparticipation from day-ahead to real-time, i.e., postponing some of its\ndischarge from day-ahead to real-time. Third, there is reduction in real-time\nresponsiveness, or discharging less in response to smoothing real-time demand\nthan centrally optimal. We quantify each of the three forms of distortions in\nterms of market fundamentals. To illustrate our results, we calibrate our model\nto Los Angeles and Houston and show that the loss from incentive misalignment\ncould be consequential.",

We strengthen existing best-or-both-worlds\nfairness results in committee voting and resolve an open question posed by Aziz\net al. (2023).

The principal can offer an arbitrary\nmenu of product bundles, but faces competition from smaller and more agile\nsingle-item sellers. The single-item sellers choose their prices after the\nprincipal commits to a menu, potentially under-cutting the principal's\nofferings. We explore to what extent the principal can leverage the ability to\nbundle product together to extract revenue.\n  Any choice of menu by the principal induces an oligopoly pricing game between\nthe single-item sellers, which may have multiple equilibria. When there is only\na single item this model reduces to Bertrand competition, for which the\nprincipal's revenue is $0$ at any equilibrium, so we assume that no single\nitem's value is too dominant. We establish an upper bound on the principal's\noptimal revenue at every equilibrium: the expected welfare after truncating\neach item's value to its revenue-maximizing price. Under a technical condition\non the value distributions -- that the monopolist's revenue is sufficiently\nsensitive to price -- we show that the principal seller can simply price the\ngrand-bundle and ensure (in any equilibrium) a constant approximation to this\nbound (and hence to the optimal revenue). We also show that for some value\ndistributions violating our conditions, grand-bundle pricing does not yield a\nconstant approximation to the optimal revenue in any equilibrium.",

However, the information is also\nvaluable to a third party as it may extract more revenue from the consumer in\nanother market called the product market. The paper characterizes the\nconstrained optimal mechanism for the service provider subject to incentive\nfeasibility. It is shown that the service provider sometimes sells no\ninformation or only partial information in order to preserve profits in the\nservice market. In a general setup, the service provision distortion and\nno-price discrimination in the product market are exclusive. Moreover, a ban on\ndata trade may reduce social welfare because it makes it harder to price\ndiscriminate in the product market.",

Since such price\ndiscrimination might create market segments with vastly different posted\nprices, we consider regulating these prices, specifically, via restricting them\nto lie within an interval. Given a price interval, we consider segmentations of\nthe market where a seller, who is oblivious to the existence of such\nregulation, still posts prices within the price interval. We show the following\nsurprising result: For any market and price interval where such segmentation is\nfeasible, there is always a different segmentation that optimally transfers all\nexcess surplus to the consumers. In addition, we characterize the entire space\nof buyer and seller surplus that are achievable by such segmentation, including\nmaximizing seller surplus, and simultaneously minimizing buyer and seller\nsurplus.",

        "abstract": "When making decisions under uncertainty, individuals often deviate from\nrational behavior, which can be evaluated across three dimensions: risk\npreference, probability weighting, and loss aversion. Given the widespread use\nof large language models (LLMs) in decision-making processes, it is crucial to\nassess whether their behavior aligns with human norms and ethical expectations\nor exhibits potential biases. Several empirical studies have investigated the\nrationality and social behavior performance of LLMs, yet their internal\ndecision-making tendencies and capabilities remain inadequately understood.\nThis paper proposes a framework, grounded in behavioral economics, to evaluate\nthe decision-making behaviors of LLMs. Through a multiple-choice-list\nexperiment, we estimate the degree of risk preference, probability weighting,\nand loss aversion in a context-free setting for three commercial LLMs:\nChatGPT-4.0-Turbo, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.0-pro. Our results reveal that\nLLMs generally exhibit patterns similar to humans, such as risk aversion and\nloss aversion, with a tendency to overweight small probabilities. However,\nthere are significant variations in the degree to which these behaviors are\nexpressed across different LLMs. We also explore their behavior when embedded\nwith socio-demographic features, uncovering significant disparities. For\ninstance, when modeled with attributes of sexual minority groups or physical\ndisabilities, Claude-3-Opus displays increased risk aversion, leading to more\nconservative choices. These findings underscore the need for careful\nconsideration of the ethical implications and potential biases in deploying\nLLMs in decision-making scenarios. Therefore, this study advocates for\ndeveloping standards and guidelines to ensure that LLMs operate within ethical\nboundaries while enhancing their utility in complex decision-making\nenvironments.",

In practice, however, the\nvalidator set changes over time, potentially eroding the protocol's security\nguarantees. For example, systems with accountable safety may lose some of that\naccountability over time as adversarial validators exit. As a result, protocols\nmust rate limit entry and exit so that the set changes slowly enough to ensure\nsecurity. Here, the system designer faces a fundamental trade-off. Slower exits\nincrease friction, making it less attractive to stake in the first place.\nFaster exits provide more utility to stakers but weaken the protocol's\nsecurity.\n  This paper provides the first systematic study of exit queues for\nProof-of-Stake blockchains. Given a collection of validator-set consistency\nconstraints imposed by the protocol, the social planner's goal is to provide a\nconstrained-optimal mechanism that minimizes disutility for the participants.\nWe introduce the MINSLACK mechanism, a dynamic capacity first-come-first-served\nqueue in which the amount of stake that can exit in a period depends on the\nnumber of previous exits and the consistency constraints. We show that MINSLACK\nis optimal when stakers equally value the processing of their withdrawal. When\nstakers values are heterogeneous, the optimal mechanism resembles a priority\nqueue with dynamic capacity. However, this mechanism must reserve exit capacity\nfor the future in case a staker with a much higher need for liquidity arrives.\nWe conclude with a survey of known consistency constraints and highlight the\ndiversity of existing exit mechanisms.",

We begin by studying the static case ($T=1$) and establish that the\noptimal mechanism involves two types of subsidization: one that increases the\noverall probability of allocation to all buyers, and another that favors the\ngroups which otherwise have a lower probability of winning the item. We then\nextend our results to the dynamic case by characterizing a set of recursive\nfunctions that determine the optimal allocation and payments in each round.\nNotably, our results establish that in the dynamic case, the seller, on the one\nhand, commits to a participation bonus to incentivize truth-telling, and on the\nother hand, charges an entry fee for every round. Moreover, the optimal\nallocation once more involves subsidization, which its extent depends on the\ndifference in future utilities for both the seller and buyers when allocating\nthe item to one group versus the others. Finally, we present an approximation\nscheme to solve the recursive equations and determine an approximately optimal\nand fair allocation efficiently.",

We study this problem in the case in which each\nagent focuses on the value she gets, and fairness notions are restricted to be\n{\\em share based}.

Moreover,\nthe ratio of half is best possible. More generally, we provide tight\ncharacterizations of what can be achieved, both ex-post (as single allocations)\nand ex-ante (as expected values of distributions of allocations), both for\ngoods and for chores.

However, the existing literature has yet to identify the\nspecific conditions under which these models outperform traditional pricing\nmodels like Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost Per Action (CPA). To fill the gap,\nthis paper builds an economic model that compares OCPC with CPC and CPA\ntheoretically, which incorporates out-site scenarios and outside options as two\nkey factors. Our analysis reveals that OCPC can effectively replace CPA by\ntackling the problem of advertisers strategically manipulating conversion\nreporting in out-site scenarios where conversions occur outside the advertising\nplatform. Furthermore, OCPC exhibits the potential to surpass CPC in platform\npayoffs by providing higher advertiser payoffs and consequently attracting more\nadvertisers. However, if advertisers have less competitive outside options and\nconsistently stay in the focal platform, the platform may achieve higher\npayoffs using CPC. Our findings deliver valuable insights for online\nadvertising platforms in selecting optimal pricing models, and provide\nrecommendations for further enhancing their payoffs. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study to analyze OCPC from an economic\nperspective. Moreover, our analysis can be applied to the OCPM model as well.",

A novel framework has\nbeen introduced to address this issue, focusing on the coevolutionary\nrelationship between human behavior and common-pool resources within a\nhuman-environment system. However, the impact of the Allee effect on the\ncoevolution and its resource sustainability is still unexplored. The Allee\neffect, a biological phenomenon characterized by a correlation between resource\navailability and growth rate, is a fundamental attribute of numerous natural\nresources. In this paper, we introduce two coevolutionary models of resource\nand strategy under replicator dynamics and knowledge feedback by applying the\nAllee effect to the common-pool resources within human-environment system.\nThese models encapsulate various facets of resource dynamics and the players'\nbehavior, such as resource growth function, the extraction rates, and the\nstrategy update rules. We find that the Allee effect can induce bi-stability\nand critical transition, leading to either sustainable or unsustainable\noutcomes depending on the initial condition and parameter configuration. We\ndemonstrate that knowledge feedback enhances the resilience and sustainability\nof the coevolving system, and these results advances the understanding of\nhuman-environment system and management of common-pool resources.",

In the complete-information repeated\ngame, a folk theorem holds, with payoff multiplicity arising due to both the\nregime's dynamic incentives and agents' stage-game strategic complementarities.\nNeither the regime's reputational incentives nor belief dispersion among agents\n(via global-games type uncertainty) alone meaningfully refine the equilibrium\npayoff set. Together, though, the interaction between these two forces uniquely\nselect the regime's highest payoff in equilibrium. Furthermore, under a Markov\nrefinement, they select a unique equilibrium where the regime plays their\noptimal commitment action. Methodologically, I develop tools to analyze\nrepeated games with endogenous exit where the regime's commitment action\nflexibly varies with their discount rate.",

        "abstract": "Dependency length minimization is a universally observed quantitative\nproperty of natural languages. However, the extent of dependency length\nminimization, and the cognitive mechanisms through which the language processor\nachieves this minimization remain unclear. This research offers mechanistic\ninsights by postulating that moving a short preverbal constituent next to the\nmain verb explains preverbal constituent ordering decisions better than global\nminimization of dependency length in SOV languages. This approach constitutes a\nleast-effort strategy because it's just one operation but simultaneously\nreduces the length of all preverbal dependencies linked to the main verb. We\ncorroborate this strategy using large-scale corpus evidence across all seven\nSOV languages that are prominently represented in the Universal Dependency\nTreebank. These findings align with the concept of bounded rationality, where\ndecision-making is influenced by 'quick-yet-economical' heuristics rather than\nexhaustive searches for optimal solutions. Overall, this work sheds light on\nthe role of bounded rationality in linguistic decision-making and language\nevolution.",

We identify a generalization of the rule, called\nApproval-IRV, that allows voters more freedom by allowing them to give equal\npreference to several candidates. Such weak orders are a more expressive input\nformat than linear orders, and they help reduce the cognitive effort of voting.\n  Just like standard IRV, Approval-IRV proceeds in rounds by successively\neliminating candidates. It interprets each vote as an approval vote for its\nmost-preferred candidates among those that have not been eliminated. At each\nstep, it eliminates the candidate who is approved by the fewest voters. Among\nthe large class of scoring elimination rules, we prove that Approval-IRV is the\nunique way of extending IRV to weak orders that preserves its characteristic\naxiomatic properties, in particular independence of clones and respecting a\nmajority's top choices. We also show that Approval-IRV is the unique extension\nof IRV among rules in this class that satisfies a natural monotonicity property\ndefined for weak orders.\n  Prior work has proposed a different generalization of IRV, which we call\nSplit-IRV, where instead of approving, each vote is interpreted as splitting 1\npoint equally among its top choices (for example, 0.25 points each if a vote\nhas 4 top choices), and then eliminating the candidate with the lowest score.\nSplit-IRV fails independence of clones, may not respect majority wishes, and\nfails our monotonicity condition.\n  The multi-winner version of IRV is known as Single Transferable Vote (STV).\nWe prove that Approval-STV continues to satisfy the strong proportional\nrepresentation properties of STV, underlining that the approval way is the\nright way of extending the IRV/STV idea to weak orders.",

The median rule has\nbeen extensively studied since and is now known simply as Kemeny's rule. It\nexhibits majoritarian properties, so for example if more than half of the input\nrankings are the same, then the output of the rule is the same ranking.\n  We observe that this behavior is undesirable in many rank aggregation\nsettings. For example, when we rank objects by different criteria (quality,\nprice, etc.) and want to aggregate them with specified weights for the\ncriteria, then a criterion with weight 51% should have 51% influence on the\noutput instead of 100%. We show that the Squared Kemeny rule (i.e., the mean\nrule) behaves this way, by establishing a bound on the distance of the output\nranking to any input rankings, as a function of their weights. Furthermore, we\ngive an axiomatic characterization of the Squared Kemeny rule, which mirrors\nthe existing characterization of the Kemeny rule but replaces the majoritarian\nCondorcet axiom by a proportionality axiom. Finally, we discuss the computation\nof the rule and show its behavior in a simulation study.",

In our model, we derive that the preference\nshifting of consumers is the main reason for the cash flow decreasing to its\nbreak-even line over time, while the visibility broadening leads to initial\ngrowth, resulting in rainbow-shaped cash flow and its life cycle. Moreover, the\nintensified spatial competition will lead to an unexpected decrease in the\nstore's cash flow, or even closure.

        "abstract": "Stable matchings are a cornerstone of market design, with numerous practical\ndeployments backed by a rich, theoretically-tractable structure. However, in\nschool-choice problems, stable matchings are not Pareto optimal for the\nstudents. Priority-neutral matchings, introduced by Reny (AER, 2022),\ngeneralizes the set of stable matchings by allowing for certain priority\nviolations, and there is always a Pareto optimal priority-neutral matching.\nMoreover, like stable matchings, the set of priority-neutral matchings forms a\nlattice.\n  We study the structure of the priority-neutral lattice. Unfortunately, we\nshow that much of the simplicity of the stable matching lattice does not hold\nfor the priority-neutral lattice. In particular, we show that the\npriority-neutral lattice need not be distributive. Moreover, we show that the\ngreatest lower bound of two matchings in the priority-neutral lattice need not\nbe their student-by-student minimum, answering an open question. This show that\nmany widely-used properties of stable matchings fail for priority-neutral\nmatchings; in particular, the set of priority-neutral matchings cannot be\nrepresented by via a partial ordering on a set of rotations. However, by\nproving a novel structural property of the set of priority-neutral matchings,\nwe also show that not every lattice arises as a priority-neutral lattice, which\nsuggests that the exact nature of the family of priority-neutral lattices may\nbe subtle.",

In production networks where upstream\nrisk is highly correlated and supplier relationships are not observable, the\nmarginal risk reduction of adding an additional supplier is low, because this\nadditional supplier's risk is likely to be correlated to that of the firm's\nexisting suppliers. This channel reduces firm incentives to diversify, which\ngives rise to inefficiently fragile production networks.\n  By solving the social planner problem, I show that, if the risk reduction\nexperienced downstream resulting from upstream diversification were to be\ninternalised by upstream firms, endogenous production networks would be\nresilient to most levels of risk. Furthermore, I show that imperfect\ninformation yields inefficient but more robust supply chains. Despite its\nstylised form, the model identifies the trade-off firms face when diversifying\nrisk and isolates the mechanism that aggregates these decisions into a\nproduction network. Furthermore, it maps the conditions of the trade-off, such\nas expected profits of the firm or the sourcing costs, to the properties of the\nproduction network.",

We formalize and study these questions through the\nprototypical problem of robust pricing under various information structures,\nincluding support, moments, and percentiles of the distribution of values. We\nprovide a unified analysis of three focal robust criteria across various\ninformation structures and evaluate the relative performance of mechanisms\noptimized for each criterion against the others. We find that mechanisms\noptimized for one criterion often perform poorly against other criteria,\nhighlighting the risk of overfitting to a particular robustness criterion.\nRemarkably, we show it is possible to design mechanisms that achieve good\nperformance across all three criteria simultaneously, suggesting that\ndecision-makers need not compromise among criteria.",

The platform must decide when to show an ad during the session. By\ndelaying the auction, the auctioneer acquires information about an ad's\nquality, improving her chances of selecting a high quality ad. However\ninformation is costly, because delay reduces market thickness and in turn\nrevenue. When should the auctioneer allocate the impression to balance these\nforces?\n  We develop a theoretical model to study the effect of market design on the\ntrade-off between market thickness and information. In particular, we focus on\nfirst- and second-price auctions. The auctioneer can commit to the auction\nformat, but not to its timing: her decision can thus be cast as a real options\nproblem. We show that under optimal stopping the first-price auction allocates\nefficiently but with delay. Instead, the second-price auction generates more\nrevenue by avoiding delay.

This approach treats\nlarge-scale micro-agents as a population, to optimize macroeconomic policies by\nlearning the dynamic response of this micro-population. Our experimental\nresults indicate that the SMFG approach outperforms real-world macroeconomic\npolicies, existing AI-based and economic methods, enabling the learned\nmacroeconomic policy to achieve the highest performance while guiding\nlarge-scale micro-agents toward maximal social welfare. Additionally, when\nextended to real-world scenarios, households that do not adopt the SMFG policy\nexperience lower utility and wealth than adopters, thereby increasing the\nattractiveness of our policy. In summary, this paper contributes to the field\nof AI for economics by offering an effective tool for modeling and solving\nmacroeconomic policymaking issues.",

The last two indicators implement the\nso-called pro-rata and user-centric models, which are extensively applied to\ndistribute revenues in the music streaming market. The axioms we propose\nformalize different principles of fairness, stability, and non-manipulability,\nand are tailor-made for the streaming context. We complete our analysis with a\ncase study that measures the influence of the 19 most-followed streamers\nworldwide on the Twitch platform.",

The framework captures various contexts such\nas school choice, public housing, organ transplant and manipulations of\nclassification algorithms. We first provide a canonical class of mechanisms for\nthese settings. The key idea is to treat the submission of hard information as\nan observable and payoff-relevant action and the contractible part of the\nmechanism as a mapping from submitted scores to a distribution over decisions\n(a score-based decision rule). Each type report triggers a distribution over\nscore submission requests and a distribution over decision rules. We provide\nconditions under which score-based mechanisms are without loss of generality.\nIn other words, situations under which the agent does not make any type reports\nand decides without a mediator what score to submit in a score-based decision\nrule. We proceed to characterize optimal approval mechanisms in the presence of\nmanipulable hard information. In several leading settings optimal mechanisms\nare score-based (and thus do not rely on soft information) and involve costly\nscreening. The solution methodology we employ is suitable both for concave cost\nfunctions and quadratic costs and is applicable to a wide range of contexts in\neconomics and in computer science.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have seen a surge of artificial currency-based mechanisms in\ncontexts where monetary instruments are deemed unfair or inappropriate, e.g.,\nin allocating food donations to food banks, course seats to students, and, more\nrecently, even for traffic congestion management. Yet the applicability of\nthese mechanisms remains limited in repeated auction settings, as it is\nchallenging for users to learn how to bid an artificial currency that has no\nvalue outside the auctions. Indeed, users must jointly learn the value of the\ncurrency in addition to how to spend it optimally. In this work, we study the\nproblem of learning to bid in two prominent classes of artificial currency\nauctions: those in which currency, which users spend to obtain public\nresources, is only issued at the beginning of a finite period; and those where,\nin addition to the initial currency endowment, currency payments are\nredistributed to users at each time step. In the latter class, the currency has\nbeen referred to as karma, since users do not only spend karma to obtain public\nresources but also gain karma for yielding them. In both classes, we propose a\nsimple learning strategy, called adaptive karma pacing, and show that this\nstrategy a) is asymptotically optimal for a single user bidding against\ncompeting bids drawn from a stationary distribution; b) leads to convergent\nlearning dynamics when all users adopt it; and c) constitutes an approximate\nNash equilibrium as the number of users grows. Our results require a novel\nanalysis in comparison to adaptive pacing strategies in monetary auctions,\nsince we depart from the classical assumption that the currency has known value\noutside the auctions, and moreover consider that the currency is both spent and\ngained in the class of auctions with redistribution.",

Amidst the immense excitement for this new technology, its future\ndevelopment and applications in the creative industry hinge crucially upon two\ncopyright issues: 1) the compensation to creators whose content has been used\nto train generative AI models (the fair use standard); and 2) the eligibility\nof AI-generated content for copyright protection (AI-copyrightability). While\nboth issues have ignited heated debates among academics and practitioners, most\nanalysis has focused on their challenges posed to existing copyright doctrines.\nIn this paper, we aim to better understand the economic implications of these\ntwo regulatory issues and their interactions. By constructing a dynamic model\nwith endogenous content creation and AI model development, we unravel the\nimpacts of the fair use standard and AI-copyrightability on AI development, AI\ncompany profit, creators income, and consumer welfare, and how these impacts\nare influenced by various economic and operational factors. For example, while\ngenerous fair use (use data for AI training without compensating the creator)\nbenefits all parties when abundant training data exists, it can hurt creators\nand consumers when such data is scarce. Similarly, stronger AI-copyrightability\n(AI content enjoys more copyright protection) could hinder AI development and\nreduce social welfare. Our analysis also highlights the complex interplay\nbetween these two copyright issues. For instance, when existing training data\nis scarce, generous fair use may be preferred only when AI-copyrightability is\nweak. Our findings underscore the need for policymakers to embrace a dynamic,\ncontext-specific approach in making regulatory decisions and provide insights\nfor business leaders navigating the complexities of the global regulatory\nenvironment.",

The market mechanism\nconforms with the cost-causation principle and guarantees community members a\nsurplus level no less than their maximum surplus when they autonomously face\nthe DSO. The dynamic and uniform community price is a monotonically decreasing\nfunction of the community's aggregate renewable generation.

An ideal aggregation mechanism would be Pareto\nefficient, strategyproof, and fair. Most previous work assumes that agents\nevaluate budgets according to the $\\ell_1$ distance to their ideal budget. We\ninvestigate and compare different models from the larger class of star-shaped\nutility functions - a multi-dimensional generalization of single-peaked\npreferences. For the case of two alternatives, we extend existing results by\nproving that under very general assumptions, the uniform phantom mechanism is\nthe only strategyproof mechanism that satisfies proportionality - a minimal\nnotion of fairness introduced by Freeman et al.

Moving to the case of\nmore than two alternatives, we establish sweeping impossibilities for $\\ell_1$\nand $\\ell_\\infty$ disutilities: no mechanism satisfies efficiency,\nstrategyproofness, and proportionality. We then propose a new kind of\nstar-shaped utilities based on evaluating budgets by the ratios of shares\nbetween a given budget and an ideal budget. For these utilities, efficiency,\nstrategyproofness, and fairness become compatible. In particular, we prove that\nthe mechanism that maximizes the Nash product of individual utilities is\ncharacterized by group-strategyproofness and a core-based fairness condition.",

Crucially, we assume the principal\ncares only about maximizing the agents' probabilities of success, not how much\nof the budget it expends. We first show that a contract is optimal for some\nobjective if and only if it is a successful-get-everything contract. An\nimmediate consequence of this result is that piece-rate contracts and\nbonus-pool contracts are never optimal in this setting. We then show that for\nany objective, there is an optimal priority-based weighted contract, which\nassigns positive weights and priority levels to the agents, and splits the\nbudget among the highest-priority successful agents, with each such agent\nreceiving a fraction of the budget proportional to her weight. This result\nprovides a significant reduction in the dimensionality of the principal's\noptimal contract design problem and gives an interpretable and easily\nimplementable optimal contract. Finally, we discuss an application of our\nresults to the design of optimal contracts with two agents and quadratic costs.\nIn this context, we find that the optimal contract assigns a higher weight to\nthe agent whose success it values more, irrespective of the heterogeneity in\nthe agents' cost parameters. This suggests that the structure of the optimal\ncontract depends primarily on the bias in the principal's objective and is, to\nsome extent, robust to the heterogeneity in the agents' cost functions.",

While tools for collecting and processing data\ncontinue to progress, this has not addressed the problem of \"unknown unknowns\",\nor fundamental informational limitations on part of the evaluator. To guide the\nchoice of metrics in the face of this informational problem, we turn to the\nevaluated agents themselves, who may have more information about how to measure\ntheir own outcomes. We model this interaction as an agency game, where we ask:\n\"When does an agent have an incentive to reveal the observability of a metric\nto their evaluator?\" We show that an agent will prefer to reveal metrics that\ndifferentiate the most difficult tasks from the rest, and conceal metrics that\ndifferentiate the easiest. We further show that the agent can prefer to reveal\na metric \"garbled\" with noise over both fully concealing and fully revealing.\nThis indicates an economic value to privacy that yields Pareto improvement for\nboth the agent and evaluator. We demonstrate these findings on data from online\nrideshare platforms.",

But (3) if the agent uses\nmean-based learning algorithms (which can be no-regret but not no-swap-regret),\nthen the principal can sometimes do significantly better than $U^*$. These\nresults not only refine previous results in Stackelberg games and contract\ndesign, but also lead to new results for Bayesian persuasion with a learning\nagent and all generalized principal-agent problems where the agent does not\nhave private information.",

        "abstract": "We study a three-layer data market comprising users (data owners), platforms,\nand a data buyer. Each user benefits from platform services in exchange for\ndata, incurring privacy loss when their data, albeit noisily, is shared with\nthe buyer. The user chooses platforms to share data with, while platforms\ndecide on data noise levels and pricing before selling to the buyer. The buyer\nselects platforms to purchase data from. We model these interactions via a\nmulti-stage game, focusing on the subgame Nash equilibrium. We find that when\nthe buyer places a high value on user data (and platforms can command high\nprices), all platforms offer services to the user who joins and shares data\nwith every platform. Conversely, when the buyer's valuation of user data is\nlow, only large platforms with low service costs can afford to serve users. In\nthis scenario, users exclusively join and share data with these low-cost\nplatforms. Interestingly, increased competition benefits the buyer, not the\nuser: as the number of platforms increases, the user utility does not\nnecessarily improve while the buyer utility improves. However, increasing the\ncompetition improves the overall utilitarian welfare. Building on our analysis,\nwe then study regulations to improve the user utility. We discover that banning\ndata sharing maximizes user utility only when all platforms are low-cost. In\nmixed markets of high- and low-cost platforms, users prefer a minimum noise\nmandate over a sharing ban. Imposing this mandate on high-cost platforms and\nbanning data sharing for low-cost ones further enhances user utility.",

        "abstract": "Users bid in a transaction fee mechanism (TFM) to get their transactions\nincluded and confirmed by a blockchain protocol. Roughgarden (EC'21) initiated\nthe formal treatment of TFMs and proposed three requirements: user incentive\ncompatibility (UIC), miner incentive compatibility (MIC), and a form of\ncollusion-resilience called OCA-proofness. Ethereum's EIP-1559 mechanism\nsatisfies all three properties simultaneously when there is no contention\nbetween transactions, but loses the UIC property when there are too many\neligible transactions to fit in a single block. Chung and Shi (SODA'23)\nconsidered an alternative notion of collusion-resilience, called\nc-side-contract-proofness (c-SCP), and showed that, when there is contention\nbetween transactions, no TFM can satisfy UIC, MIC, and c-SCP for any c at least\n1. OCA-proofness asserts that the users and a miner should not be able to\n\"steal from the protocol.\" On the other hand, the c-SCP condition requires that\na coalition of a miner and a subset of users should not be able to profit\nthrough strategic deviations (whether at the expense of the protocol or of the\nusers outside the coalition).\n  Our main result is the first proof that, when there is contention between\ntransactions, no (possibly randomized) TFM in which users are expected to bid\ntruthfully satisfies UIC, MIC, and OCA-proofness. This result resolves the main\nopen question in Roughgarden (EC'21). We also suggest several relaxations of\nthe basic model that allow our impossibility result to be circumvented.",

An automated market maker (AMM) is a mechanism that offers to trade\naccording to some predetermined schedule; the best choice of this schedule\ndepends on the market maker's goals. The literature on the design of AMMs has\nmainly focused on prediction markets with the goal of information elicitation.\nMore recent work motivated by DeFi has focused instead on the goal of profit\nmaximization, but considering only a single type of good (traded with a\nnumeraire), including under adverse selection (Milionis et al. 2022). Optimal\nmarket making in the presence of multiple goods, including the possibility of\ncomplex bundling behavior, is not well understood. In this paper, we show that\nfinding an optimal market maker is dual to an optimal transport problem, with\nspecific geometric constraints on the transport plan in the dual. We show that\noptimal mechanisms for multiple goods and under adverse selection can take\nadvantage of bundling, both improved prices for bundled purchases and sales as\nwell as sometimes accepting payment \"in kind.\" We present conjectures of\noptimal mechanisms in additional settings which show further complex behavior.\nFrom a methodological perspective, we make essential use of the tools of\ndifferentiable economics to generate conjectures of optimal mechanisms, and\ngive a proof-of-concept for the use of such tools in guiding theoretical\ninvestigations.",

In each round, a\nnew cake arrives, which is identical to the ones in previous rounds. Alice cuts\nthe cake at a point of her choice, while Bob chooses the left piece or the\nright piece, leaving the remainder for Alice. We consider two versions:\nsequential, where Bob observes Alice's cut point before choosing left/right,\nand simultaneous, where he only observes her cut point after making his choice.\nThe simultaneous version was first considered by Aumann and Maschler (1995).\n  We observe that if Bob is almost myopic and chooses his favorite piece too\noften, then he can be systematically exploited by Alice through a strategy akin\nto a binary search. This strategy allows Alice to approximate Bob's preferences\nwith increasing precision, thereby securing a disproportionate share of the\nresource over time.\n  We analyze the limits of how much a player can exploit the other one and show\nthat fair utility profiles are in fact achievable. Specifically, the players\ncan enforce the equitable utility profile of $(1/2, 1/2)$ in the limit on every\ntrajectory of play, by keeping the other player's utility to approximately\n$1/2$ on average while guaranteeing they themselves get at least approximately\n$1/2$ on average. We show this theorem using a connection with Blackwell\napproachability.\n  Finally, we analyze a natural dynamic known as fictitious play, where players\nbest respond to the empirical distribution of the other player. We show that\nfictitious play converges to the equitable utility profile of $(1/2, 1/2)$ at a\nrate of $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$.",

However, numerous theoretical models do not seem to\nconvincingly explain these phenomena.\n  This paper is motivated by a recent line of work, studying models where\npolarization can be explained in terms of biased assimilation and geometric\ninterplay between opinions on various topics. The agent opinions are\nrepresented as unit vectors on a multidimensional sphere and updated according\nto geometric rules. In contrast to previous work, we focus on the classical\nopinion exchange setting, where the agents update their opinions in discrete\ntime steps, with a pair of agents interacting randomly at every step. The\nopinions are updated according to an update rule belonging to a general class.\n  Our findings are twofold. First, polarization appears to be ubiquitous in the\nclass of models we study, requiring only relatively modest assumptions\nreflecting biased assimilation. Second, there is a qualitative difference\nbetween two-dimensional dynamics on the one hand, and three or more dimensions\non the other. Accordingly, we prove almost sure polarization for a large class\nof update rules in two dimensions. Then, we prove polarization in three and\nmore dimensions in more limited cases and try to shed light on central\ndifficulties that are absent in two dimensions.",

Finally, we demonstrate that increasing the privacy\nlevel does not necessarily intensify these effects.

This problem requires a method to define and regulate safe and\noptimal limits of AI behaviors. In this work, we propose HALO (Hormetic\nALignment via Opponent processes), a regulatory paradigm that uses hormetic\nanalysis to regulate the behavioral patterns of AI. Behavioral hormesis is a\nphenomenon where low frequencies of a behavior have beneficial effects, while\nhigh frequencies are harmful. By modeling behaviors as allostatic opponent\nprocesses, we can use either Behavioral Frequency Response Analysis (BFRA) or\nBehavioral Count Response Analysis (BCRA) to quantify the hormetic limits of\nrepeatable behaviors. We demonstrate how HALO can solve the 'paperclip\nmaximizer' scenario, a thought experiment where an unregulated AI tasked with\nmaking paperclips could end up converting all matter in the universe into\npaperclips. Our approach may be used to help create an evolving database of\n'values' based on the hedonic calculus of repeatable behaviors with decreasing\nmarginal utility. This positions HALO as a promising solution for the\nvalue-loading problem, which involves embedding human-aligned values into an AI\nsystem, and the weak-to-strong generalization problem, which explores whether\nweak models can supervise stronger models as they become more intelligent.\nHence, HALO opens several research avenues that may lead to the development of\na computational value system that allows an AI algorithm to learn whether the\ndecisions it makes are right or wrong.",

        "abstract": "An agenda-setter repeatedly proposes a spatial policy to voters until some\nproposal is accepted. Voters have distinct but correlated preferences and\nreceive private signals about the common state. I investigate whether the\nagenda-setter retains the power to screen voters as players become perfectly\npatient and private signals become perfectly precise. I show that the extent of\nthis power depends on the relative precision of private signals and the\nconflict of preferences among voters, confirming the crucial role of committee\nsetting and single-peaked preferences. When the private signals have equal\nprecision, the agenda-setter can achieve the full-information benchmark. When\none voter receives an asymptotically more precise signal, the agenda-setter's\npower to screen depends on preference diversity. These results imply that the\nlack of commitment to a single proposal can benefit the agenda-setter.\nSurprisingly, an increase in the voting threshold can allow the agenda-setter\nto extract more surplus.",

        "abstract": "To the best of our knowledge, a complete characterization of the domains that\nescape the famous Arrow's impossibility theorem remains an open question. We\nbelieve that different ways of proving Arrovian theorems illuminate this\nproblem. This paper presents a new combinatorial topology proof of Arrow's\ntheorem. In PODC 2022, Rajsbaum and Ravent\\'os-Pujol proved this theorem using\na combinatorial topology approach. This approach uses simplicial complexes to\nrepresent the sets of profiles of preferences and that of single preferences.\nThese complexes grow in dimension with the number of alternatives. This makes\nit difficult to think about the geometry of Arrow's theorem when there are\n(any) finite number of voters and alternatives. Rajsbaum and Ravent\\'os-Pujol\n(2022) use their combinatorial topology approach only for the base case of two\nvoters and three alternatives and then proceed by induction to prove the\ngeneral version. The problem with this strategy is that it is unclear how to\nstudy domain restrictions in the general case by focusing on the base case and\nthen using induction. Instead, the present article uses the two-dimensional\nstructure of the high-dimensional simplicial complexes (formally, the\n$2$$\\unicode{x2013}$skeleton), yielding a new combinatorial topology proof of\nthis theorem. Moreover, we do not assume the unrestricted domain, but a domain\nrestriction that we call the class of polarization and diversity over triples,\nwhich includes the unrestricted domain. By doing so, we obtain a new\ngeneralization of Arrow's theorem. This shows that the combinatorial topology\napproach can be used to study domain restrictions in high dimensions through\nthe $2$$\\unicode{x2013}$skeleton.",

Here we show, using data from Bank of Italy's Survey on\nHousehold Income and Wealth and Forbes Italian billionaires lists, that the\nlast hypothesis is not justified in Italy. We find that, even if an equilibrium\nasymptotic distribution exists, the average wealth has no finite asymptotic\nvalue. As a consequence we find that - without changes in the parameters of the\nwealth evolution process - wealth inequality is bound to diverge with time. In\naddition we evaluate the equilibration time of the evolution process when its\nparameters are chosen in order to admit both an equilibrium distribution and a\nfinite equilibrium average wealth. Even when both the equilibrium hypotheses\nare satisfied, we find equilibration times much longer than the typical time\nspan between economic shocks.",

Moreover, we investigate how the notion of the\nmultiplier can help us in macroeconomic analysis of capital and investment\ndynamics and in understanding some general principles of capital market\nequilibrium. Using the concept of this multiplier, we build a macroeconomic\nmodel of capital market dynamics which is consistent with the implications of\nclassical models and with the market equilibrium condition but gives additional\nquantitative and qualitative predictions regarding the dynamics of shares of\ninvestment into the production of consumer goods and the production of means of\nproduction. The investment volume is modeled as a function of the multiplier:\ninvestments adjust when the value of the multiplier fluctuates around its\nequilibrium value of one. In addition, we suggest possible connections between\nthe investment volume and the multiplier value in the form of differential\nequations. We also present the formula for the rate of growth of the\nmultiplier. Independently of the implications of capital market dynamics\nmodels, the formula for the multiplier itself can be applied for the evaluation\nof the present value of capital or the estimation of the macroeconomic impact\nof changes in investment volumes.

Typically, they involve repeated\nstrategic interactions of the principal and agent, taking place under\nuncertainty and over time. While appealing in theory, players seldom use\ncomplex dynamic strategies in practice, often preferring to circumvent\ncomplexity and approach uncertainty through learning. We initiate the study of\nrepeated contracts with a learning agent, focusing on agents who achieve\nno-regret outcomes.\n  Optimizing against a no-regret agent is a known open problem in general\ngames; we achieve an optimal solution to this problem for a canonical contract\nsetting, in which the agent's choice among multiple actions leads to\nsuccess/failure. The solution has a surprisingly simple structure: for some\n$\\alpha > 0$, initially offer the agent a linear contract with scalar $\\alpha$,\nthen switch to offering a linear contract with scalar $0$. This switch causes\nthe agent to ``free-fall'' through their action space and during this time\nprovides the principal with non-zero reward at zero cost. Despite apparent\nexploitation of the agent, this dynamic contract can leave \\emph{both} players\nbetter off compared to the best static contract. Our results generalize beyond\nsuccess/failure, to arbitrary non-linear contracts which the principal rescales\ndynamically.\n  Finally, we quantify the dependence of our results on knowledge of the time\nhorizon, and are the first to address this consideration in the study of\nstrategizing against learning agents.",

In such a context it is plausible that\nalgorithms could arrive at prices that are higher than the competitive prices\nand this may benefit sellers at the expense of consumers (i.e., the buyers in\nthe market). This paper gives a definition of plausible algorithmic\nnon-collusion for pricing algorithms.

Algorithms that have colluded on, e.g., supra-competitive prices cannot\npass the audit. The definition allows sellers to possess useful side\ninformation that may be correlated with supply and demand and could affect the\nprices used by good algorithms.

First, it produces the divine coincidence: it guarantees\nthat the rate of inflation is on target whenever the rate of unemployment is\nefficient. Second, whenever the Beveridge curve shifts, the Phillips curve\nshifts if it is formulated with inflation and unemployment, but it remains\nunaffected if it is formulated with inflation and labor-market tightness.\nThird, the Phillips curve displays a kink at the point of divine coincidence if\nwe assume that wage decreases -- which reduce workers' morale -- are more\ncostly to producers than price increases -- which upset customers.

These\ncosts reduce the amount of resources that can go to recruiting workers and\namplify how unemployment responds to changes in productivity. Workers also\nincur up-front costs upon accepting jobs. Examples include moving expenses and\nregulatory fees. I establish that workers' costs lessen the response of\nunemployment to productivity changes and do not subtract from resources\navailable for recruitment. The influence of workers' costs is bounded by\nproperties of a matching function, which describes how job openings and\nunemployment produce hires. Using data on job finding that are adjusted for\nworkers' transitions between employment and unemployment and for how the Job\nOpenings and Labor Turnover Survey records hires, I estimate a bound that\nascribes limited influence to workers' costs. The results demonstrate that\ncosts paid by workers upon accepting jobs affect outcomes in the labor market\n(firms threaten workers with paying the up-front costs again if wage\nnegotiations fail), but their influence on volatility is less important than\nfirms' costs.",

On the contrary, when\ninformation is dense, the space is completely polarised in equilibrium with the\npresence of multiple \"local truths\" which oscillate in periodic cycles. We find\nthat when preferences are uniformly distributed, the equilibrium level of\nhatred depends solely on the value of the practical punishment associated with\nholding a hate belief.

For rank-dependent utility agents that are\nneither risk averse or risk seeking, we show that jackpot allocations can be\nPareto optimal for small-scale payoffs, but for large-scale payoffs they are\ndominated by proportional allocations, thus explaining the often-observed\nsmall-stake gambling behaviour in a risk sharing context.

        "abstract": "Many countries around the world, including Korea, use the school choice\nlottery system. However, this method has a problem in that many students are\nassigned to less-preferred schools based on the lottery results. In addition,\nthe task of finding a good assignment with ties often has a time complexity of\nNP, making it a very difficult problem to improve the quality of the\nassignment.\n  In this paper, we prove that the problem of finding a stable matching that\nmaximizes the student-oriented preference utility in a two-sided market with\none-sided preference can be solved in polynomial time, and we verify through\nexperiments that the quality of assignment is improved. The main contributions\nof this paper are as follows. We found that stable student-oriented allocation\nin a two-sided market with one-sided preferences is the same as stable\nallocation in a two-sided market with symmetric preferences. In addition, we\ndefined a method to quantify the quality of allocation from a preference\nutilitarian perspective. Based on the above two, it was proven that the problem\nof finding a stable match that maximizes the preference utility in a two-sided\nmarket with homogeneous preferences can be reduced to an allocation problem. In\nthis paper, through an experiment, we quantitatively verified that optimal\nstudent assignment assigns more students to schools of higher preference, even\nin situations where many students are assigned to schools of low preference\nusing the existing assignment method.",

Understanding the factors that\ninfluence consumer participation in CSA is crucial, yet the complete picture\nand interrelations of these factors remain unclear in existing studies. This\nresearch adopts a scoping review and the KJ method to elucidate the factors\ninfluencing consumer participation in CSA and to theorize the consumer\nparticipation. In particular, we focus on the dynamics of individual\ndecision-making for participation, under the premise that individuals are\nembedded in socio-cultural environments. We examine the decision-making process\nbased on the seesaw of expected gains and losses from participation, along with\nthe reflexivity to the individual and the process of updating decision-making\npost-participation. Our study highlights how individual decision-making for\nparticipation is influenced by relationships with others within the embedded\nsocio-cultural environment, as well as by attachment and connection to the\ncommunity. It also shows that discrepancies between expectations and\nexperiences post-participation, and the transformation of the social capital,\npromote the updating of decision-making processes. In addition, among the\nfactors identified in this study for participation in CSA, the decision to\nparticipate was heavily influenced by expectations of variety of ingredients,\nsuggesting that other factors such as food education and learning\nopportunities, contribution to environmental and social issues, and connections\nwith people and nature had little impact. Although there are limitations, the\ninsights gained from this study offer profound implications for stakeholders\nand provide valuable insights for more sustainable and efficient CSA practices.",

        "abstract": "We study the problem of screening in decision-making processes under\nuncertainty, focusing on the impact of adding an additional screening stage,\ncommonly known as a 'gatekeeper.' While our primary analysis is rooted in the\ncontext of job market hiring, the principles and findings are broadly\napplicable to areas such as educational admissions, healthcare patient\nselection, and financial loan approvals. The gatekeeper's role is to assess\napplicants' suitability before significant investments are made. Our study\nreveals that while gatekeepers are designed to streamline the selection process\nby filtering out less likely candidates, they can sometimes inadvertently\naffect the candidates' own decision-making process. We explore the conditions\nunder which the introduction of a gatekeeper can enhance or impede the\nefficiency of these processes. Additionally, we consider how adjusting\ngatekeeping strategies might impact the accuracy of selection decisions. Our\nresearch also extends to scenarios where gatekeeping is influenced by\nhistorical biases, particularly in competitive settings like hiring. We\ndiscover that candidates confronted with a statistically biased gatekeeping\nprocess are more likely to withdraw from applying, thereby perpetuating the\npreviously mentioned historical biases. The study suggests that measures such\nas affirmative action can be effective in addressing these biases. While\ncentered on hiring, the insights and methodologies from our study have\nsignificant implications for a wide range of fields where screening and\ngatekeeping are integral.",

Our main result suggests a novel\nrationale for the widely observed binary wage schemes, by showing that such\nsimple contracts achieve the optimal convergence rate.

The correct Phillips curve agrees with the zero limit from the trend\ninflation framework. It contains a large lagged inflation coefficient and a\nsmall response to expected inflation. Price dispersion can be first or second\norder depending how shocks are scaled. The response to the output gap is always\nmuted and is zero at standard parameters.

In particular, we add two axioms\nstating that the voting method should mitigate spoiler effects and avoid the\nso-called strong no show paradox. We prove a theorem stating that any\npreferential voting method satisfying our enlarged set of axioms, which\nincludes some weak homogeneity and preservation axioms, must choose from among\nthe Minimax winners in all three-alternative elections. When applied to more\nthan three alternatives, our axioms also distinguish Minimax from other known\nvoting methods that coincide with or refine Minimax for three alternatives.",

Fanaticism thus undermines the\n`democratic' motivation for accommodating multiple ethical perspectives. The\nproblem of fanaticism has not yet been mathematically defined. Representing\nmoral uncertainty as an instance of social welfare aggregation, this paper\ncontributes to the field of moral uncertainty by 1) formalising the problem of\nfanaticism as a property of social welfare functionals and 2) providing\nnon-fanatical alternatives to MEC, i.e. Highest k-trimmed Mean and Highest\nMedian.",

However, this characterization\nrelies on a model where the output is a ranking of committees instead of a set\nof winning committees and no full characterization of ABC scoring rules exists\nin the latter standard setting. We address this issue by characterizing two\nimportant subclasses of ABC scoring rules in the standard ABC election model,\nthereby both extending the result of Lackner and Skowron (2021) to the standard\nsetting and refining it to subclasses. In more detail, by relying on a\nconsistency axiom for variable electorates, we characterize (i) the prominent\nclass of Thiele rules and (ii) a new class of ABC voting rules called ballot\nsize weighted approval voting. Based on these theorems, we also infer\ncharacterizations of three well-known ABC voting rules, namely multi-winner\napproval voting, proportional approval voting, and satisfaction approval\nvoting.",

The economic\nsystem is mainly divided into (1) gift and reciprocity, (2) power and\nredistribution, (3) market exchange, and (4) mutual aid without reciprocal\nobligations. The current inequality stems from a capitalist economy consisting\nof (2) and (3). To sublimate (1), which is the human economy, to (4), the\nconcept of a \"mixbiotic society\" has been proposed in the philosophical realm.\nThis is a society in which free and diverse individuals, \"I,\" mix with each\nother, recognize their respective \"fundamental incapability\" and sublimate them\ninto \"WE\" solidarity. The economy in this society must have moral\nresponsibility as a coadventurer and consideration for vulnerability to risk.\nTherefore, I focus on two factors of mind perception: moral responsibility and\nrisk vulnerability, and propose a novel model of wealth distribution following\nan econophysical approach. Specifically, I developed a joint-venture model, a\nredistribution model in the joint-venture model, and a \"WE economy\" model. A\nsimulation comparison of a combination of the joint ventures and redistribution\nwith the WE economies reveals that WE economies are effective in reducing\ninequality and resilient in normalizing wealth distribution as advantages, and\nsusceptible to free riders as disadvantages. However, this disadvantage can be\ncompensated for by fostering consensus and fellowship, and by complementing it\nwith joint ventures. This study essentially presents the effectiveness of moral\nresponsibility, the complementarity between the WE economy and the joint\neconomy, and the direction of the economy toward reducing inequality. Future\nchallenges are to develop the WE economy model based on real economic analysis\nand psychology, as well as to promote WE economy fieldwork for worker coops and\nplatform cooperatives to realize a desirable mixbiotic society.",

In this note, we introduce a novel framework that naturally\nseparates social preferences from selfish preferences to answer the following\nquestion: What specific forms of social preferences can be accommodated within\nthe expected utility paradigm? In a departure from existing frameworks, our\nframework reveals that ex ante social preferences are not inherently in\nconflict with expected utility in games, provided a decision-maker's aversion\nto randomization in selfish utility \"counterbalances\" her social preference for\nrandomization. We also show that when a player's preferences in both the game\n(against another player) and the associated decision problem (against Nature)\nconform to expected utility axioms, the permissible range of social preferences\nbecomes notably restricted. Only under this condition do we reaffirm the\nexisting literature's key insight regarding the incompatibility of ex ante\ninequality aversion with expected utility.",

        "abstract": "The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to fundamentally\nreshape the knowledge economy by solving problems at scale. This paper\nintroduces a framework to study this transformation, incorporating AI into an\neconomy where humans form hierarchical firms: Less knowledgeable individuals\nbecome \"workers\" solving routine problems, while more knowledgeable individuals\nbecome \"solvers,\" assisting workers with exceptional problems. We model AI as a\ntechnology that transforms computing power into \"AI agents,\" which can either\noperate autonomously (as co-workers or solvers/co-pilots) or non-autonomously\n(only as co-pilots). We show that basic autonomous AI displaces humans towards\nspecialized problem solving, leading to smaller, less productive, and less\ndecentralized firms. In contrast, advanced autonomous AI reallocates humans to\nroutine work, resulting in larger, more productive, and more decentralized\nfirms. While autonomous AI primarily benefits the most knowledgeable\nindividuals, non-autonomous AI disproportionately benefits the least\nknowledgeable. However, autonomous AI achieves higher overall output. These\nfindings reconcile seemingly contradictory empirical evidence and reveal key\ntradeoffs involved in regulating AI autonomy.",

Thus, incentives for private tree owners to invest in tree care\nmay fall short of those of a public forest manager aiming to optimize ecosystem\nservice benefits for society. The management of a forest pest provides a\nsalient focus area because pests threaten public goods provision and pest\nmanagement generates feedback that mitigates future risks to forests. We use a\ngame theoretic model to determine optimal pest treatment subsidies for a focal\nprivately owned tree and use an optimization approach to guide targeted public\ntreatment of a representative public tree. We find that optimal public\nsubsidies for private tree treatment depend on assessed tree health and on the\nprevalence of the pest in the community, considerations absent from many\nexisting programs. Next, by applying our pest treatment policies to a\ncommunity-scale model of emerald ash borer forest pest dynamics, we predict ash\nmortality under a range of treatment scenarios over a 50-year time horizon. Our\nresults highlight how designing policies that consider the public goods\nbenefits of private actions can contribute to sustainable land management.",

Shortly after the merge, when\nMEV-Boost was in its infancy, most block builders were neutral, meaning they\ndid not trade themselves but rather aggregated transactions from other traders.\nOver time, integrated builders, operated by trading firms, began to overtake\nmany of the neutral builders. Outside of the integrated builder teams, little\nis known about which advantages integration confers beyond latency and how\nlatency advantages distort on-chain trading.\n  This paper explores these poorly understood advantages. We make two\ncontributions. First, we point out that integrated builders are able to bid\ntruthfully in their own bundle merge and then decide how much profit to take\nlater in the final stages of the PBS auction when more information is\navailable, making the auction for them look closer to a second-price auction\nwhile independent searchers are stuck in a first-price auction. Second, we find\nthat latency disadvantages convey a winner's curse on slow bidders when\nunderlying values depend on a stochastic price process that change as bids are\nsubmitted.",

In our setting, the sequence of\nrealized states of nature may be adversarially chosen, the Agent is non-myopic,\nand the Principal aims for a strong form of policy regret. Following Camara,\nHartline, and Johnson, we model the Agent's long-run behavior with behavioral\nassumptions that relax the common prior assumption (for example, that the Agent\nhas no swap regret). Within this framework, we revisit the mechanism proposed\nby Camara et al., which informally uses calibrated forecasts of the unknown\nstates of nature in place of a common prior. We give two main improvements.\nFirst, we give a mechanism that has an exponentially improved dependence (in\nterms of both running time and regret bounds) on the number of distinct states\nof nature. To do this, we show that our mechanism does not require truly\ncalibrated forecasts, but rather forecasts that are unbiased subject to only a\npolynomially sized collection of events -- which can be produced with\npolynomial overhead. Second, in several important special cases -- including\nthe focal linear contracting setting -- we show how to remove strong\n``Alignment'' assumptions (which informally require that near-ties are always\nbroken in favor of the Principal) by specifically deploying ``stable'' policies\nthat do not have any near ties that are payoff relevant to the Principal. Taken\ntogether, our new mechanism makes the compelling framework proposed by Camara\net al. much more powerful, now able to be realized over polynomially sized\nstate spaces, and while requiring only mild assumptions on Agent behavior.",

We explain this rejection\nbehavior via the following principle: if the responder regrets less about\nlosing the offer than the proposer regrets not offering the best option, the\noffer is rejected. This principle qualifies as a rational punishing behavior\nand it replaces the experimentally falsified classical rationality (the subgame\nperfect Nash equilibrium) that leads to accepting any non-zero offer. The\nprinciple is implemented via the transitive regret theory for probabilistic\nlotteries. The expected utility implementation is a limiting case of this. We\nshow that several experimental results normally prescribed to fairness and\nintent-recognition can be given an alternative explanation via rational\npunishment; e.g. the comparison between \"fair\" and \"superfair\", the behavior\nunder raising the stakes etc. Hence we also propose experiments that can\ndistinguish these two scenarios (fairness versus regret-based punishment). They\nassume different utilities for the proposer and responder. We focus on the\nmini-ultimatum version of the game and also show how it can emerge from a more\ngeneral setup of the game.",

Each agent's\nhidden action includes a dimension that determines whether they undertake an\nextra costly step to adhere to safety protocols. The principal's objective is\nto use payments combined with a limited budget for random inspections to\nincentivize agents towards safety-compliant actions that maximize the\nprincipal's utility. We first focus on the single-agent setting with linear\ncontracts and present an efficient algorithm that characterizes the optimal\nlinear contract, which includes both payment and random inspection. We further\ninvestigate how the optimal contract changes as the inspection cost or the cost\nof adhering to safety protocols vary. Notably, we demonstrate that the agent's\ncompensation increases if either of these costs escalates. However, while the\nprobability of inspection decreases with rising inspection costs, it\ndemonstrates nonmonotonic behavior as a function of the safety action costs.\nLastly, we explore the multi-agent setting, where the principal's challenge is\nto determine the best distribution of inspection budgets among all agents. We\npropose an efficient approach based on dynamic programming to find an\napproximately optimal allocation of inspection budget across contracts. We also\ndesign a random sequential scheme to determine the inspector's assignments,\nensuring each agent is inspected at most once and at the desired probability.\nFinally, we present a case study illustrating that a mere difference in the\ncost of inspection across various agents can drive the principal's decision to\nforego inspecting a significant fraction of them, concentrating its entire\nbudget on those that are less costly to inspect.",

To address this question, we introduce a dynamic\nsocial learning framework, where agents rely on general rules of thumb and\nimitate the behavioral rules of successful peers. We find the social learning\noutcome can be characterized independent of the initial rule distribution. When\none dominant general rule consistently yields superior problem-specific\noutcomes, social learning almost surely leads all agents to adopt this dominant\nrule; otherwise, provided the population is sufficiently large, the better rule\nfor the more frequent problem becomes the consensus rule with arbitrarily high\nprobability. As a result, the behavioral rule selected by the social learning\nprocess need not maximize social welfare. We complement our theoretical\nanalysis with an application to the market sentiment selection in a stochastic\nproduction market.",

In\nessence, game theory deals with the analysis of strategic interactions among\nmultiple decision-makers. The theory has had enormous impact in a wide variety\nof fields, but its rigorous mathematical analysis is rather recent. It started\nwith the pioneering work of von Neumann and Morgenstern published in 1944.\nSince then, game theory has taken centre stage in applied mathematics and\nrelated areas. Game theory has also played an important role in unsuspected\nareas: for instance in military applications, when the analysis of guided\ninterceptor missiles in the 1950s motivated the study of games evolving\ndynamically in time. Such games (when possibly subject to randomness) are\ncalled stochastic differential games. Their study started with the work of\nIssacs, who crucially recognised the importance of (stochastic) control theory\nin the area. Over the past few decades since Isaacs's work, a rich theory of\nstochastic differential game has emerged and branched into several directions.\nThis paper will review recent advances in the study of solvability of\nstochastic differential games, with a focus on a purely probabilistic technique\nto approach the problem. Unsurprisingly, the number of players involved in the\ngame is a major factor of the analysis. We will explain how the size of the\npopulation impacts the analyses and solvability of the problem, and discuss\nmean field games as well as the convergence of finite player games to mean\nfield games.",

We generalize our\nfindings to allow for distortions of the probabilities assigned to both states\nand signals, which nests the functional forms widely used in studying\nprobabilistic biases (e.g., Grether, 1980 and Benjamin, 2019). We show how\ncoherent distorted beliefs are tightly related to several extant models of\nmotivated beliefs: they are the outcome of maximizing anticipated expected\nutility subject to a generalized Kullback-Liebler cost of distortion. Moreover,\nin the domain of lottery choice, we link coherent distortions to explanations\nof non-expected utility like the Allais paradox: individuals who maximize\nsubjective expected utility maximizers conditional on coherent distorted\nbeliefs are equivalent to the weighted utility maximizers studied by Chew\n[1983].",

        "abstract": "Sustainability of common-pool resources hinges on the interplay between human\nand environmental systems. However, there is still a lack of a novel and\ncomprehensive framework for modelling extraction of common-pool resources and\ncooperation of human agents that can account for different factors that shape\nthe system behavior and outcomes. In particular, we still lack a critical value\nfor ensuring resource sustainability under different scenarios. In this paper,\nwe present a novel framework for studying resource extraction and cooperation\nin human-environmental systems for common-pool resources. We explore how\ndifferent factors, such as resource availability and conformity effect,\ninfluence the players' decisions and the resource outcomes. We identify\ncritical values for ensuring resource sustainability under various scenarios.\nWe demonstrate the observed phenomena are robust to the complexity and\nassumptions of the models and discuss implications of our study for policy and\npractice, as well as the limitations and directions for future research.",

The valuation of the electronic currencies will\nbe based on macroeconomic theory and the fundamental equation of monetary\npolicy, not the microeconomic theory of discounted cash flows.

The view will\nbe developed of the electronic currency management firm as an entity\nresponsible for coordinated monetary (electronic currency supply and value\nstabilization) and fiscal (investment and operational) policies of a\nsubstantial (for liquidity of the electronic currency) sub-economy. The risk\nmodel used in the valuations and the decision-making will not be the\nubiquitous, yet inappropriate, exponential risk model that leads to discount\nrates, but will be multi time scale models that capture the true risk. The\ndecision-making will be approached from the perspective of true systems control\nbased on a system response function given by the multi scale risk model and\nsystem controllers that utilize the Deep Reinforcement Learning, Generative\nPretrained Transformers, and other methods of Generative Artificial\nIntelligence (genAI).

We study a market in which buyers have quasilinear\nutilities with linear substitutes valuations and budget constraints, and the\nseller must find prices and an envy-free allocation that maximise revenue or\nwelfare. Our setup mirrors markets such as ad auctions and auctions for the\nexchange of financial assets. We prove that the unique competitive equilibrium\nprices are also envy-free revenue-maximal. This coincidence of maximal revenue\nand welfare is surprising and breaks down even when buyers have\npiecewise-linear valuations. We present a novel characterisation of the set of\n\"feasible\" prices at which demand does not exceed supply, show that this set\nhas an elementwise minimal price vector, and demonstrate that these prices\nmaximise revenue and welfare.

Concurrently, horizontal\nreservations are employed within each vertical category to allocate positions\nfor additional subgroups, such as women and individuals with disabilities.

Despite drastic differences between the dictatorships in\nthe world, one of the key common features is the \\emph{Dictator's Dilemma} as\ndefined by Wintrobe [1]: a dictator will never know the true state of affairs\nin his country and is perpetually presented distorted information, thus having\ndifficulties in making the right governing decisions. The dictator's dilemma is\nessential to most autocratic regimes and is one of the key features in the\nliterature on the subject. Yet, no quantitative theory of how the distortion of\ninformation develops from the initial state has been developed up to date. I\npresent a model of the appearance and evolution of such information distortion,\nwith subsequent degradation of control by the dictator. The model is based on\nthe following fundamental and general premises: a) the dictator governs aiming\nto follow the desired trajectory of development based only on the information\nfrom the advisors; b) the deception from the advisors cannot decrease in time;\nand c) the deception change depends on the difficulties the country encounters.\nThe model shows effective control in the short term (a few months to a year),\nfollowed by instability leading to the country's gradual deterioration of the\nstate over many years. I derive some universal parameters applicable to all\ndictators and show that advisors' deception increases parallel with the decline\nof the control. In contrast, the dictator thinks the government is doing a\nreasonable, but not perfect, job. Finally, I present a match of our model to\nthe historical data of grain production in the Soviet Union in 1928-1940.",

The first result of the\npaper shows that if a rollup transaction arrival rate is too low, it prefers to\nuse the regular blockspace market for data posting, as it offers a more\nflexible cost structure. Second, we show that shared blob posting is not always\nbeneficial for participating rollups and change in the aggregate blob posting\ncost in the equilibrium depends on the types of participating rollups.

In this paper, our focus narrows to the single contract\ninterpretation wherein we establish a theoretical framework for community\nrating using Stiglitz's (1977) monopoly model in which there is a continuum of\nagents. We exhibit profitability conditions and show that, under mild\nregularity conditions, the optimal premium is unique and satisfies the inverse\nelasticity rule. Our numerical analysis, using realistic parameter values,\nreveals that under regulation, a 10% increase in indemnity is possible with\nminimal impact on other variables.",

In our multi-dimensional model, there is a sharp phase transition: if $k$\ndenotes the number of dimensions, then when $\\lambda \\cdot (k-1) \\geq 1$, no\nnon-trivial competitive ratio is possible. On the other hand, when $\\lambda\n\\cdot (k-1) < 1$, we give a tight bound on the achievable competitive ratio\n(similar to Kleinberg et al.). As another example, Kleinberg et al. uncovers an\nexponential improvement in their competitive ratio for the random-order vs.\nworst-case prophet inequality problem. In our model with $k\\geq 2$ dimensions,\nthe gap is at most a constant-factor. We uncover several additional key\ndifferences in the multi- and single-dimensional models.",

Many interesting models have been proposed to account for these\nregularities, notably agent-based models, which mimic the two empirical laws\nthrough a complex mix of nonlinear mechanisms such as traders' switching\nbetween trading strategies in highly nonlinear way. This paper explains the two\nregularities simply in terms of traders' attitudes towards news, an explanation\nthat follows almost by definition of the traditional dichotomy of financial\nmarket participants, investors versus speculators, whose behaviors are reduced\nto their simplest forms. Long-run investors' valuations of an asset are assumed\nto follow a news-driven random walk, thus capturing the investors' persistent,\nlong memory of fundamental news. Short-term speculators' anticipated returns,\non the other hand, are assumed to follow a news-driven autoregressive process,\ncapturing their shorter memory of fundamental news, and, by the same token, the\nfeedback intrinsic to the short-sighted, trend-following (or herding) mindset\nof speculators. These simple, linear, models of traders' expectations, it is\nshown, explain the two financial regularities in a generic and robust way.\nRational expectations, the dominant model of traders' expectations, is not\nassumed here, owing to the famous no-speculation, no-trade results",

Flickering, where a system vacillates between\nalternative stable states, is touted as a useful early warning signal of\nirreversible transitions to undesirable ecological regimes. However, while\nflickering may presage an ecological tipping point, these dynamics also pose\nunique challenges for human adaptation. In this work, we link an ecological\nmodel that can exhibit flickering to a model of human adaptation to a changing\nenvironment. This allows us to explore the impact of flickering on the utility\nof adaptive agents in a coupled socio-environmental system. We highlight the\nconditions under which flickering causes wellbeing to decline\ndisproportionately, and explore how these dynamics impact the optimal timing of\na transformational change that partially decouples wellbeing from environmental\nvariability. The implications of flickering on nomadic communities in Mongolia,\nartisanal fisheries, and wildfire systems are explored as possible case\nstudies. Flickering, driven in part by climate change and changes to governance\nsystems, may already be impacting communities. We argue that governance\ninterventions investing in adaptive capacity could blunt the negative impact of\nflickering that can occur as socio-environmental systems pass through tipping\npoints, and therefore contribute to the sustainability of these systems.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a novel family of mechanisms for constrained allocation problems\nwhich we call local priority mechanisms. These mechanisms are parameterized by\na function which assigns a set of agents, the local compromisers, to every\ninfeasible allocation. The mechanism then greedily attempts to match agents\nwith their top choices. Whenever it reaches an infeasible allocation, the local\ncompromisers move to their next favorite alternative. Local priority mechanisms\nexist for any constraint, so this provides a method of constructing new designs\nfor any constrained allocation problem. We give axioms which characterize local\npriority mechanisms. Since constrained allocation includes many canonical\nproblems as special constraints, we apply this characterization to show that\nseveral well-known mechanisms, including deferred acceptance for school choice,\ntop trading cycles for house allocation, and serial dictatorship can be\nunderstood as instances of local priority mechanisms. Other mechanisms,\nincluding the Boston mechanism, are not local priority mechanisms. We give\nsufficient conditions for a local priority mechanism to be group\nstrategy-proof. We also provide conditions which enable welfare comparisons\nacross local priority mechanisms.",

Some of the best known indices, such\nas those proposed by Hirsch and Woeginger, are designed to reward most highly\nthose records that strike some balance between productivity (number of papers\npublished), and impact (frequency with which those papers are cited). A large\nnumber of rarely cited publications will not score well, nor will a very small\nnumber of heavily cited papers. We discuss three new citation indices, one of\nwhich was independently proposed in \\cite{FHLB}. Each rests on the notion of\nscale invariance, fundamental to John Nash's solution of the two-person\nbargaining problem. Our main focus is on one of these -- a scale invariant\nversion of the Hirsch index. We argue that it has advantages over the original;\nit produces fairer rankings within subdisciplines, is more decisive\n(discriminates more finely, yielding fewer ties) and more dynamic (growing over\ntime via more frequent, smaller increments), and exhibits enhanced centrality\nand tail balancedness. Simulations suggest that scale invariance improves\nrobustness under Poisson noise, with increased decisiveness having no cost in\nterms of the number of ``accidental\" reversals, wherein random irregularities\ncause researcher A to receive a lower index value than B, although A's\nproductivity and impact are both slightly higher than B's. Moreover, we provide\nan axiomatic characterization of the scale invariant Hirsch index, via axioms\nthat bear a close relationship, in discrete analogue, to those used by Nash in\n\\cite{Nas50}. This argues for the mathematical naturality of the new index.\n  An earlier version was presented at the 5th World Congress of the Game Theory\nSociety, Maastricht, Netherlands in 2016.",

Each agent's\nintrinsic factor is modeled as a private random variable, and the external\nfactor is modeled as a solution of the designer's optimization problem. If the\ndesigner chooses an optimal value of external factor as public information, the\ntype-adjustable mechanism may yield Pareto-optimal outcomes, which let the\ndesigner and each agent obtain more expected payoffs than what they would\nobtain at most in the traditional optimal mechanisms. As a comparison, in an\nauction with interdependent values, only the seller will benefit from public\ninformation which is represented as a random variable.

We show that these two properties both (i)\nare compatible with individual rationality and strategy-proofness, and (ii)\nhelp us to identify two specific mechanisms. To be more precise, on various\ndomains of preference profiles, together with other well-studied properties\n(individual rationality, strategy-proofness, and non-bossiness), coordinatewise\nefficiency and pairwise efficiency respectively characterize two extensions of\nthe top-trading-cycles mechanism (TTC): the coordinatewise top-trading-cycles\nmechanism (cTTC) and the bundle top-trading-cycles mechanism (bTTC). Moreover,\nwe propose several variations of our efficiency properties, and we find that\neach of them is either satisfied by cTTC or bTTC, or leads to an impossibility\nresult (together with individual rationality and strategy-proofness).\nTherefore, our characterizations can be primarily interpreted as a\ncompatibility test: any reasonable efficiency property that is not satisfied by\ncTTC or bTTC could be considered incompatible with individual rationality and\nstrategy-proofness.

We propose the framework of distorted optimal\ntransport by minimizing a distorted expected cost. This new formulation is\nmotivated by concrete problems in decision theory, robust optimization, and\nrisk management, and it has many distinct features compared to the classic\ntheory. We choose simple cost functions and study different distortion\nfunctions and their implications on the optimal transport plan. We show that on\nthe real line, the comonotonic coupling is optimal for the distorted optimal\ntransport problem when the distortion function is convex and the cost function\nis submodular and monotone. Some forms of duality and uniqueness results are\nprovided. For inverse-S-shaped distortion functions and linear cost, we obtain\nthe unique form of optimal coupling for all marginal distributions, which turns\nout to have an interesting ``first comonotonic, then counter-monotonic\"\ndependence structure; for S-shaped distortion functions a similar structure is\nobtained. Our results highlight several challenges and features in distorted\noptimal transport, offering a new mathematical bridge between the fields of\nprobability, decision theory, and risk management.",

Thus, in the equivalence analysis, while the CBDC\nintroduction has no real effects on the economy, it does not guarantee full\nneutrality as it affects banks' business models. In a dynamic model extension,\nwe analyze the effects of an increase in the CBDC and show that the CBDC not\nonly does not cause bank disintermediation or crowd out of deposits but may\nfoster an expansion of bank credit to firms.",

As AI triumphalism is the\norder of the day, we proceed by way of grounded case studies, each illustrating\nthe capabilities of these novel tools in distinct ways. Taking well-known\ncontracts opinions, and sourcing the actual agreements that they adjudicated,\nwe show that AI models can help factfinders ascertain ordinary meaning in\ncontext, quantify ambiguity, and fill gaps in parties' agreements. We also\nillustrate how models can calculate the probative value of individual pieces of\nextrinsic evidence. After offering best practices for the use of these models\ngiven their limitations, we consider their implications for judicial practice\nand contract theory. Using LLMs permits courts to estimate what the parties\nintended cheaply and accurately, and as such generative interpretation\nunsettles the current interpretative stalemate. Their use responds to\nefficiency-minded textualists and justice-oriented contextualists, who argue\nabout whether parties will prefer cost and certainty or accuracy and fairness.\nParties--and courts--would prefer a middle path, in which adjudicators strive\nto predict what the contract really meant, admitting just enough context to\napproximate reality while avoiding unguided and biased assimilation of\nevidence. As generative interpretation offers this possibility, we argue it can\nbecome the new workhorse of contractual interpretation.",

Using a dichotomous preference\nscale termed generalized approval evaluation we construct an $m$-person\ncoalitional game which is more commonly called a cooperative game with\ntransferable utilities. To identify each alternative's score we use the Shapley\nvalue (Shapley, 1953) of the cooperative game we construct for the purpose.

        "abstract": "In Network games under cooperative framework, the position value is a link\nbased allocation rule. It is obtained from the Shapley value of an associated\ncooperative game where the links of the network are considered players. The\nShapley value of each of the links is then divided equally among the players\nwho form those links. The inherent assumption is that the value is indifferent\nto the weights of the players in the network. Depending on how much central a\nplayer is in the network, or the ability of making links with other players\netc., for example, players can be considered to have weights. Thus, in such\nsituations, dividing the Shapley value equally among the players can be an\nover-simplistic notion. We propose a generalised version of the position value:\nthe weighted position value that allocates the Shapley shares proportional to\nthe players' weights. These weights of the players are exogenously given. We\nprovide two axiomatic characterizations of our value. Finally, a bidding\nmechanism is formulated to show that any sub-game perfect equilibrium (SPE) of\nthis mechanism coincides with the weighted position value.",

In\nparticular, each player has a private and noisy measurement of the state\nprocess but can see the history of their opponent's actions. The challenge of\nthis asymmetry is that it introduces correlations into the players' belief\nprocesses for the state and leads to circularity in their beliefs about their\nopponents beliefs. We show that by leveraging the information available through\ntheir opponent's actions, both players can enhance their state estimates and\nimprove their overall outcomes. In addition, we provide a closed-form solution\nfor the Bayesian updating rule of their belief process.

Our\napproach to identifying a consensus partial order is motivated by the\nobservation that collections of votes that form a cycle can be treated as\ncollective ties. Our approach then removes unions of cycles of votes, or\ncirculations, from the vote graph and determines aggregate preferences from the\nremainder. Specifically, we study the removal of maximal circulations attained\nby any union of cycles the removal of which leaves an acyclic graph. We\nintroduce the strong maximum circulation, the removal of which guarantees a\nunique outcome in terms of the induced partial order, called the strong partial\norder. The strong maximum circulation also satisfies strong complementary\nslackness conditions, and is shown to be solved efficiently as a network flow\nproblem. We further establish the relationship between the dual of the maximum\ncirculation problem and Kemeny's method, a popular optimization-based approach\nfor preference aggregation. We also show that identifying a minimum maximal\ncirculation -- i.e., a maximal circulation containing the smallest number of\nvotes -- is an NP-hard problem. Further an instance of the minimum maximal\ncirculation may have multiple optimal solutions whose removal results in\nconflicting partial orders.",

        "abstract": "Comonotonicity (``same variation'') of random variables minimizes hedging\npossibilities and has been widely used, e.g., in Gilboa and Schmeidler's\nambiguity models. This paper investigates anticomonotonicity (``opposite\nvariation''; abbreviated ``AC''), the natural counterpart to comonotonicity. It\nminimizes leveraging rather than hedging possibilities. Surprisingly, AC\nrestrictions of several traditional axioms do not give new models. Instead,\nthey strengthen the foundations of existing classical models: (a) linear\nfunctionals through Cauchy's equation; (b) Anscombe-Aumann expected utility;\n(c) as-if-risk-neutral pricing through no-arbitrage; (d) de Finetti's\nbookmaking foundation of Bayesianism using subjective probabilities; (e) risk\naversion in Savage's subjective expected utility. In each case, our\ngeneralizations show where the critical tests of classical axioms lie: in the\nAC cases (maximal hedges). We next present examples where AC restrictions do\nessentially weaken existing axioms, and do provide new properties and new\nmodels.",

The state transitions are Markovian\nand the sender seeks to maximize the long-run average reward by committing to a\n(possibly history-dependent) signaling mechanism. While most previous studies\nof Markov persuasion consider exogenous agent beliefs that are independent of\nthe chain, we study a more natural variant with endogenous agent beliefs that\ndepend on the chain's realized history. A key challenge to analyze such\nsettings is to model the agents' partial knowledge about the history\ninformation. We analyze a Markov persuasion process (MPP) under various\ninformation models that differ in the amount of information the receivers have\nabout the history of the process. Specifically, we formulate a general\npartial-information model where each receiver observes the history with an\n$\\ell$ period lag. Our technical contribution start with analyzing two\nbenchmark models, i.e., the full-history information model and the no-history\ninformation model. We establish an ordering of the sender's payoff as a\nfunction of the informativeness of agent's information model (with no-history\nas the least informative), and develop efficient algorithms to compute optimal\nsolutions for these two benchmarks. For general $\\ell$, we present the\ntechnical challenges in finding an optimal signaling mechanism, where even\ndetermining the right dependency on the history becomes difficult. To bypass\nthe difficulties, we use a robustness framework to design a \"simple\"\n\\emph{history-independent} signaling mechanism that approximately achieves\noptimal payoff when $\\ell$ is reasonably large.",

The\nmodel's fundamental idea is to eliminate risk by hedging the option by\npurchasing and selling the underlying asset in a specific way, that is, to\nreplicate the payoff of the option with a portfolio (which continuously trades\nthe underlying) whose value at each time can be verified. One of the most\ncrucial, yet restrictive, assumptions for this task is that the market follows\na geometric Brownian motion, which has been relaxed and generalized in various\nways.\n  The concept of robust finance revolves around developing models that account\nfor uncertainties and variations in financial markets. Martingale Optimal\nTransport, which is an adaptation of the Optimal Transport theory to the robust\nfinancial framework, is one of the most prominent directions. In this paper, we\nconsider market models with arbitrarily many underlying assets whose values are\nobserved over arbitrarily many time periods, and demonstrates the existence of\na portfolio sub- or super-hedging a general path-dependent derivative security\nin terms of trading European options and underlyings, as well as the portfolio\nreplicating the derivative payoff when the market model yields the extremal\nprice of the derivative given marginal distributions of the underlyings. In\nmathematical terms, this paper resolves the question of dual attainment for the\nmulti-period vectorial martingale optimal transport problem.",

Demand and supply, before the marginal revolution, are\ndefined not by an unobservable criterion such as a utility function, but by an\nobservable monetary variable, the reservation price: the buyer's (maximum)\nwillingness to pay (WTP) value (a potential price) and the seller's (minimum)\nwillingness to accept (WTA) value (a potential price) at the marketplace.\nMarket demand and supply are the cumulative distribution of the buyers' and\nsellers' reservation prices, respectively. This WTP-WTA classical view of\nsupply and demand formed the means whereby market participants were motivated\nin experimental economics although experimentalists (trained in neoclassical\neconomics) were not cognizant of their link to the past. On this foundation was\nerected a vast literature on the rules of trading for a host of institutions,\nmodern and ancient. This paper documents textually this reappraisal of\nclassical economics and then formalizes it mathematically. A follow-up paper\nwill articulate a theory of market price formation rooted in this classical\nview on supply and demand and in experimental findings on market behavior.",

The fat tails\nemerge in the model from the amplifying nature of speculation, leading to a\nrandom-coefficient autoregressive return process (and power-law tails); the\nvolatility clustering is due to the traders' long memory of news; bubbles are a\npersistent phenomenon in the model, and, assuming the standard lab present\nvalue pattern, the bubble size increases with the proportion of speculators and\ndecreases with the trading horizon.",

        "abstract": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau defines the notion of payoff amount\nas the amount that has to be payed at a particular time in order to completely\npay off the debt, in case the lender intends to pay off the loan early, way\nbefore the last installment is due (CFPB 2020). This amount is well-understood\nfor loans at compound interest, but much less so when simple interest is used.\n  Recently, Aretusi and Mari (2018) have proposed a formula for the payoff\namount for loans at simple interest. We assume that the payoff amounts are\nestablished contractually at time zero, whence the requirement that no\narbitrage may arise this way\n  The first goal of this paper is to study this new formula and derive it\nwithin a model of a loan market in which loans are bought and sold at simple\ninterest, interest rates change over time, and no arbitrage opportunities\nexist.\n  The second goal is to show that this formula exhibits a behaviour rather\ndifferent from the one which occurs when compound interest is used. Indeed, we\nshow that, if the installments are constant and if the interest rate is greater\nthan a critical value (which depends on the number of installments), then the\nsequence of the payoff amounts is increasing before a certain critical time,\nand will start decreasing only thereafter. We also show that the critical value\nis decreasing as a function of the number of installments. For two\ninstallments, the critical value is equal to the golden section.\n  The third goal is to introduce a more efficient polynomial notation, which\nencodes a basic tenet of the subject: Each amount of money is embedded in a\ntime position (to wit: The time when it is due). The model of a loan market we\npropose is naturally linked to this new notation.",

We vectorized jobs and employees into task and skill vector spaces,\nrespectively, while treating production techniques as a skill-task matching\nmatrix and business strategy as a task value vector. In our model, the process\nof stabilizing production techniques and optimizing business strategies\ncorresponds to the recalibration of parameters within the skill-task matching\nmatrix and the task value vector. We constructed a feed-forward neural network\nalgorithm to run this model and demonstrated how it can augment operational\nefficiency.",

        "abstract": "This paper designs a simple, efficient and truthful mechanism to to elicit\nself-evaluations about items jointly owned by owners. A key application of this\nmechanism is to improve the peer review of large scientific conferences where a\npaper often has multiple authors and many authors have multiple papers. Our\nmechanism is designed to generate an entirely new source of review data\ntruthfully elicited from paper owners, and can be used to augment the\ntraditional approach of eliciting review data only from peer reviewers.\n  Our approach starts by partitioning all submissions of a conference into\ndisjoint blocks, each of which shares a common set of co-authors. We then\nelicit the ranking of the submissions from each author and employ isotonic\nregression to produce adjusted review scores that align with both the reported\nranking and the raw review scores. Under certain conditions, truth-telling by\nall authors is a Nash equilibrium for any valid partition of the overlapping\nownership sets. We prove that to ensure truthfulness for such isotonic\nregression based mechanisms, partitioning the authors into blocks and eliciting\nonly ranking information independently from each block is necessary. This leave\nthe optimization of block partition as the only room for maximizing the\nestimation efficiency of our mechanism, which is a computationally intractable\noptimization problem in general. Fortunately, we develop a nearly linear-time\ngreedy algorithm that provably finds a performant partition with appealing\nrobust approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data\nand real-world conference review data demonstrate the effectiveness of this\nowner-assisted calibration mechanism.",

An example of such a process is t\\^atonnement, an\nauction-like algorithm first proposed in 1874 by French economist Walras in\nwhich sellers adjust prices based on the Marshallian demands of buyers. A dual\nconcept in consumer theory is a buyer's Hicksian demand. In this paper, we\nidentify the maximum of the absolute value of the elasticity of the Hicksian\ndemand, as an economic parameter sufficient to capture and explain a range of\nconvergent and non-convergent t\\^atonnement behaviors in a broad class of\nmarkets. In particular, we prove the convergence of t\\^atonnement at a rate of\n$O((1+\\varepsilon^2)/T)$, in homothetic Fisher markets with bounded price\nelasticity of Hicksian demand, i.e., Fisher markets in which consumers have\npreferences represented by homogeneous utility functions and the price\nelasticity of their Hicksian demand is bounded, where $\\varepsilon \\geq 0$ is\nthe maximum absolute value of the price elasticity of Hicksian demand across\nall buyers. Our result not only generalizes known convergence results for CES\nFisher markets, but extends them to mixed nested CES markets and Fisher markets\nwith continuous, possibly non-concave, homogeneous utility functions. Our\nconvergence rate covers the full spectrum of nested CES utilities, including\nLeontief and linear utilities, unifying previously existing disparate\nconvergence and non-convergence results. In particular, for $\\varepsilon = 0$,\ni.e., Leontief markets, we recover the best-known convergence rate of $O(1/T)$,\nand as $\\varepsilon \\to \\infty$, e.g., linear Fisher markets, we obtain\nnon-convergent behavior, as expected.",

We discuss a novel model that highlights the augmented value of\nprivate order flow for integrated builder searchers. We show that private order\nflow is complementary to top-of-block opportunities, and therefore integrated\nbuilder-searchers are more likely to participate in OFAs and outbid non\nintegrated builders. They will then parlay access to these private transactions\ninto an advantage in the PBS auction, winning blocks more often and extracting\nhigher profits than non-integrated builders. To validate our main assumptions,\nwe construct a novel dataset pairing post-merge PBS outcomes with realized\n12-second volatility on a leading CEX (Binance). Our results show that\nintegrated builder-searchers are more likely to win in the PBS auction when\nrealized volatility is high, suggesting that indeed such builders have an\nadvantage in extracting top-of-block opportunities.

We propose a Cournot duopoly\ncompetition model in which two insurers choose the number of policies they\noffer (i.e., their production level) and also the resources they invest to\nensure the quality of data regarding the cost of claims (i.e., the data quality\nof their production cost).

Here a different approach to equilibrium --\nwhat it should mean and how it may be achieved -- is offered as a constructive\nalternative.\n  Agents operate in an economic environment where adjustments to holdings have\nbeen needed in the past, will be needed again in a changed future, and money is\nfamiliar for its role in facilitating that. Marginal utility provides relative\nvalues of goods for guidance in making incremental adjustments, and with money\nincorporated into utility and taken as num\\`eraire, those values give money\nprice thresholds at which an agent will be willing to buy or sell. Agents in\npairs can then look at such individualized thresholds to see whether a trade of\nsome amount of a good for some amount of money may be mutually advantageous in\nleading to higher levels of utility. Iterative bilateral trades in this most\nbasic sense, if they keep bringing all goods and agents into play, are\nguaranteed in the limit to reach an equilibrium state in which the agents all\nagree on prices and, under those prices, have no interest in further adjusting\ntheir holdings.

In contrast to traditional accounts -- which explain the emergence\nof hoarding through the actions of Whites that keep valuable resources within\nWhite communities -- simulations, perhaps surprisingly, show hoarding to arise\neven when Whites do not play the role of hoarders of resources. Behind this\nresult is the fact that a structural inequality (i.e., racial differences in\nsocial class) -- and not action-driven hoarding -- is the necessary condition\nfor hoarding to emerge. Findings, therefore, illustrate that common\naction-driven understandings of opportunity hoarding can overlook the\nstructural foundations behind this important phenomenon.

The presented agent-based model introduces an\nendogenous similarity-based social network and employees' reactions to dynamic\nmanagement strategies informed by key company benchmarks. The value-based\ndecision-making of employees shapes the behaviour of others through their\nperception of social norms from which a corporate culture emerges. These\nelements induce intertwined feedback mechanisms which lead to unforeseen\nprofitability outcomes. The simulations reveal that variants of extreme\nadaptation of management style yield higher profitability in the long run than\nthe more moderate alternatives. Furthermore, we observe convergence towards a\ndominant management strategy with low intensity in monitoring efforts as well\nas high monetary incentivisation of cooperative behaviour. The results suggest\nthat measures increasing the connectedness of the workforce across all four\nvalue groups might be advisable to escape potential lock-in situation and thus\nraise profitability. A further positive impact on profitability can be achieved\nthrough knowledge about the distribution of personal values among a firm's\nemployees. Choosing appropriate and enabling management strategies, and\nsticking to them in the long run, can support the realisation of the inherent\nself-organisational capacities of the workforce, ultimately leading to higher\nprofitability through cultural stability.",

Such social distancing strategies will depend on\ninformation about the course of the epidemic but also on when they expect the\nepidemic to end, for instance due to vaccination. Typically it is difficult to\nmake optimal decisions, because the available information is incomplete and\nuncertain. Here, we show how optimal decision-making depends on information\nabout vaccination timing in a differential game in which individual\ndecision-making gives rise to Nash equilibria, and the arrival of the vaccine\nis described by a probability distribution. We predict stronger social\ndistancing the earlier the vaccination is expected and also the more sharply\npeaked its probability distribution. In particular, equilibrium social\ndistancing only meaningfully deviates from the no-vaccination equilibrium\ncourse if the vaccine is expected to arrive before the epidemic would have run\nits course. We demonstrate how the probability distribution of the vaccination\ntime acts as a generalised form of discounting, with the special case of an\nexponential vaccination time distribution directly corresponding to regular\nexponential discounting.",

There have been\nnumerous efforts to reduce the cost of interviewing in these markets using a\nvariety of signalling mechanisms, however, the theoretical properties of these\nmechanisms have not been systematically studied in models with rich\npreferences. In this paper we give theoretical guarantees for a variety of\nmechanisms, finding that these mechanisms must properly balance competition.\n  We consider a random market in which agents' latent preferences are based on\nobserved qualities, personal taste and (ex post) interview shocks and assume\nthat following an interview mechanism a final stable match is generated with\nrespect to preferences over interview partners. We study a novel many-to-many\ninterview match mechanism to coordinate interviews and that with relatively few\ninterviews, when suitably designed, the interview match yields desirable\nproperties.\n  We find that under the interview matching mechanism with a limit of $k$\ninterviews per candidate and per position, the fraction of positions that are\nunfilled vanishes quickly with $k$. Moreover the ex post efficiency grows\nrapidly with $k$, and reporting sincere pre-interview preferences to this\nmechanism is an $\\epsilon$-Bayes Nash equilibrium.

A selection\nmechanism, which may be randomized, selects one individual from a group of $n$\nbased on nominations among members of the group; a mechanism is impartial if\nthe selection of an individual is independent of nominations cast by that\nindividual, and $\\alpha$-optimal if under any circumstance the expected number\nof nominations received by the selected individual is at least $\\alpha$ times\nthat received by any individual. In a many-nominations model, where individuals\nmay cast an arbitrary number of nominations, the so-called permutation\nmechanism is $1/2$-optimal, and this is best possible. In the single-nomination\nmodel, where each individual casts exactly one nomination, the permutation\nmechanism does better and prior to this work was known to be $67/108$-optimal\nbut no better than $2/3$-optimal. We show that it is in fact $2/3$-optimal for\nall $n$. This result is obtained via tight bounds on the performance of the\nmechanism for graphs with maximum degree $\\Delta$, for any $\\Delta$, which we\nprove using an adversarial argument. We then show that the permutation\nmechanism is not best possible; indeed, by combining the permutation mechanism,\nanother mechanism called plurality with runner-up, and some new ideas,\n$2105/3147$-optimality can be achieved for all $n$. We finally give new upper\nbounds on $\\alpha$ for any $\\alpha$-optimal impartial mechanism.

To be robust, the seller chooses a DSIC\nmechanism that optimizes the worst-case performance relative to the first-best\nbenchmark. Our analysis unifies the regret and the ratio objectives.\n  For these objectives, we derive an optimal mechanism and the corresponding\nperformance in quasi-closed form, as a function of the support information and\nthe number of buyers n. Our analysis reveals three regimes of support\ninformation and a new class of robust mechanisms. i.) With \"low\" support\ninformation, the optimal mechanism is a second-price auction (SPA) with random\nreserve, a focal class in earlier literature. ii.) With \"high\" support\ninformation, SPAs are strictly suboptimal, and an optimal mechanism belongs to\na class of mechanisms we introduce, which we call pooling auctions (POOL);\nwhenever the highest value is above a threshold, the mechanism still allocates\nto the highest bidder, but otherwise the mechanism allocates to a uniformly\nrandom buyer, i.e., pools low types. iii.) With \"moderate\" support information,\na randomization between SPA and POOL is optimal.\n  We also characterize optimal mechanisms within nested central subclasses of\nmechanisms: standard mechanisms that only allocate to the highest bidder, SPA\nwith random reserve, and SPA with no reserve. We show strict separations in\nterms of performance across classes, implying that deviating from standard\nmechanisms is necessary for robustness.",

The\nseller only knows the empirical value distribution of the buyer population and\nchooses the revenue-optimal price. We consider a widely studied third-degree\nprice discrimination model where an information intermediary with perfect\nknowledge of the arriving buyer's value sends a signal to the seller, hence\nchanging the seller's posterior and inducing the seller to set a personalized\nposted price. Prior work of Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris (American Economic\nReview, 2015) has shown the existence of a signaling scheme that preserves\nseller revenue, while always selling the item, hence maximizing consumer\nsurplus. In a departure from prior work, we ask whether the consumer surplus\ngenerated is fairly distributed among buyers with different values. To this\nend, we aim to maximize welfare functions that reward more balanced surplus\nallocations.\n  Our main result is the surprising existence of a novel signaling scheme that\nsimultaneously $8$-approximates all welfare functions that are non-negative,\nmonotonically increasing, symmetric, and concave, compared with any other\nsignaling scheme. Classical examples of such welfare functions include the\nutilitarian social welfare, the Nash welfare, and the max-min welfare. Such a\nguarantee cannot be given by any consumer-surplus-maximizing scheme -- which\nare the ones typically studied in the literature. In addition, our scheme is\nsocially efficient, and has the fairness property that buyers with higher\nvalues enjoy higher expected surplus, which is not always the case for existing\nschemes.",

In this paper, we establish a mathematical\ntheory of real price that determines the optimal global versus local spending\nof an agent which achieves the agent's optimal tradeoff between spending and\nobtained utility. Our theory of real price depends on the asymptotic analysis\nof a Markov chain transition probability matrix related to the network of\nproducers and consumers. We show that the real price of a product or service\ncan be determined from the involved Markov chain matrix, and can be\ndramatically different from the product's label price. In particular, we show\nthat the label prices of products and services are often not ``real'' or\ndirectly ``useful'': given two products offering the same myopic utility, the\none with lower label price may not necessarily offer better asymptotic utility.\nThis theory shows that the globality or locality of the products and services\ndoes have different impacts on the spending-utility tradeoff of a customer. The\nestablished mathematical theory of real price can be used to determine whether\nto adopt or not to adopt certain artificial intelligence (AI) technologies from\nan economic perspective.",

Then, the principal selects a final solution based\non the agents' signals. In stark contrast to single-agent setting by Kleinberg\nand Kleinberg (EC'18) with an approximate Bayesian mechanism, we show that\nthere exists efficient approximate prior-independent mechanisms with both\ninformation and performance gain, thanks to the competitive tension between the\nagents. Interestingly, however, the amount of such a compelling power\nsignificantly varies with respect to the information available to the agents,\nand the degree of correlation between the principal's and the agent's utility.\nTechnically, we conduct a comprehensive study on the multi-agent delegation\nproblem and derive several results on the approximation factors of\nBayesian/prior-independent mechanisms in complete/incomplete information\nsettings. As a special case of independent interest, we obtain comparative\nstatics regarding the number of agents which implies the dominance of the\nmulti-agent setting ($n \\ge 2$) over the single-agent setting ($n=1$) in terms\nof the principal's utility.

Buyers know their own valuations and externality costs but do\nnot know this same information for other buyers. Buyers also receive private\nsignals correlated with the state and, consequently, the implementation problem\nexhibits interdependent valuations. This precludes a naive application of the\nVCG mechanism and to overcome this interdependency problem, we construct a\ntwo-stage mechanism. In the first stage, we exploit correlation in the firms\nsignals about the state to induce truthful reporting of observed signals.

If\nall agents take the best current action, learning that the underlying state has\nchanged and behavior should adapt will be slower. Diversity is harder to\nmaintain when there is fast communication between agents, because they tend to\nfind out and pursue the best action rapidly. We explore these issues using a\nmodel of (Bayesian) learning over a social network. Agents learn rapidly from\nand may also have incentives to coordinate with others to whom they are\nconnected via strong links. We show, however, that when the underlying\nenvironment changes sufficiently rapidly, any network consisting of just strong\nlinks will do only a little better than random choice in the long run. In\ncontrast, networks combining strong and weak links, whereby the latter type of\nlinks transmit information only slowly, can achieve much higher long-run\naverage payoffs. The best social networks are those that combine a large\nfraction of agents into a strongly-connected component, while still maintaining\na sufficient number of smaller communities that make diverse choices and\ncommunicate with this component via weak links.",

The RSE accounts for any possible\nup-to-$\\delta$ suboptimal follower responses in Stackelberg games and is\nadopted to improve the robustness of the leader's strategy. While a few\nvariants of robust Stackelberg equilibrium have been considered in previous\nliterature, the RSE solution concept we consider is importantly different -- in\nsome sense, it relaxes previously studied robust Stackelberg strategies and is\napplicable to much broader sources of uncertainties.\n  We provide a thorough investigation of several fundamental properties of RSE,\nincluding its utility guarantees, algorithmics, and learnability. We first show\nthat the RSE we defined always exists and thus is well-defined. Then we\ncharacterize how the leader's utility in RSE changes with the robustness level\nconsidered. On the algorithmic side, we show that, in sharp contrast to the\ntractability of computing an SSE, it is NP-hard to obtain a fully polynomial\napproximation scheme (FPTAS) for any constant robustness level. Nevertheless,\nwe develop a quasi-polynomial approximation scheme (QPTAS) for RSE. Finally, we\nexamine the learnability of the RSE in a natural learning scenario, where both\nplayers' utilities are not known in advance, and provide almost tight sample\ncomplexity results on learning the RSE. As a corollary of this result, we also\nobtain an algorithm for learning SSE, which strictly improves a key result of\nBai et al. in terms of both utility guarantee and computational efficiency.",

Material payoffs in turn affect how preferences evolve in the long run.\nTo properly model the \"match-to-interact\" process, we combine stable matching\nand equilibrium concepts. Our analysis unveils that endogenous matching gives\nrise to the \"we is greater than me\" moral perspective. This perspective is\nunderpinned by a preference that exhibits both homophily and efficiency, which\nenables individuals to reach a consensus of a collective ``we\" that transcends\nthe boundaries of the individual \"I\" and \"you.\" Such a preference stands out in\nthe evolutionary process because it is able to force positive assortative\nmatching and efficient play among individuals carrying the same preference\ntype. Under incomplete information, a strong form of homophily, which we call\nparochialism, is necessary for a preference to prevail in evolution, because\nstronger incentives are required to engage in self-sorting with information\nfriction.",

However,\nthe extent to which dependency length minimization is applied in human language\nsystems is not yet fully understood. Preverbally, the placement of\nlong-before-short constituents and postverbally, short-before-long constituents\nare known to minimize overall dependency length of a sentence. In this study,\nwe test the hypothesis that placing only the shortest preverbal constituent\nnext to the main-verb explains word order preferences in Hindi (a SOV language)\nas opposed to the global minimization of dependency length. We characterize\nthis approach as a least-effort strategy because it is a cost-effective way to\nshorten all dependencies between the verb and its preverbal dependencies. As\nsuch, this approach is consistent with the bounded-rationality perspective\naccording to which decision making is governed by \"fast but frugal\" heuristics\nrather than by a search for optimal solutions. Consistent with this idea, our\nresults indicate that actual corpus sentences in the Hindi-Urdu Treebank corpus\nare better explained by the least effort strategy than by global minimization\nof dependency lengths. Additionally, for the task of distinguishing corpus\nsentences from counterfactual variants, we find that the dependency length and\nconstituent length of the constituent closest to the main verb are much better\npredictors of whether a sentence appeared in the corpus than total dependency\nlength.

The optimal form of\npack-and-pair districting depends on the relative amounts of aggregate and\nidiosyncratic uncertainty.

        "abstract": "We examine how uncertain veracity of external news influences investor\nbeliefs, market prices and corporate disclosures. Despite assuming independence\nbetween the news' veracity and the firm's endowment with private information,\nwe find that favorable news is taken ``with a grain of salt'' in equilibrium --\nmore precisely, perceived as less likely veracious -- which reinforces investor\nbeliefs that nondisclosing managers are hiding disadvantageous information.\nHence more favorable external news could paradoxically lead to lower market\nvaluation. That is, amid management silence, stock prices may be non-monotonic\nin the positivity of external news. In line with mounting empirical evidence,\nour analysis implies asymmetric price reactions to news and price declines\nfollowing firm disclosures. We further predict that external news that is more\nlikely veracious may increase or decrease the probability of disclosure and\nlink these effects to empirically observable characteristics.",

        "abstract": "Firms compete for clients, creating distributions of market shares ranging\nfrom domination by a few giant companies to markets in which there are many\nsmall firms. These market structures evolve in time, and may remain stable for\nmany years before a new firm emerges and rapidly obtains a large market share.\nWe seek the simplest realistic model giving rise to such diverse market\nstructures and dynamics. We focus on markets in which every client adopts a\nsingle firm, and can, from time to time, switch to a different firm. Examples\ninclude markets of cell phone and Internet service providers, and of consumer\nproducts with strong brand identification. In the model, the size of a\nparticular firm, labelled $i$, is equal to its current number of clients,\n$n_i$. In every step of the simulation, a client is chosen at random, and then\nselects a firm from among the full set of firms with probability $p_i =\n(n_i^\\alpha + \\beta)/K$, where $K$ is the normalization factor. Our model thus\nhas two parameters: $\\alpha$ represents the degree to which firm size is an\nadvantage ($\\alpha$ > 1) or disadvantage ($\\alpha$ < 1), relative to strict\nproportionality to size ($\\alpha$ = 1), and $\\beta$ represents the degree to\nwhich small firms are viable despite their small size. We postulate that\n$\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are determined by the regulatory, technology, business\nculture and social environments. The model exhibits a phase diagram in the\nparameter space, with different regions of behaviour. At the large $\\alpha$\nextreme of the phase diagram, a single dominant firm emerges, whose market\nshare depends on the value of $\\beta$. At the small $\\alpha$ extreme, many\nfirms with small market shares coexist, and no dominant firm emerges. In the\nintermediate region, markets are divided among a relatively small number of\nfirms, each with sizeable market share but with distinct rankings, which can\npersist for long [...]",

To\nstrengthen this foundation, one must reckon with bounded rationality in human\ndecision-making processes, such as the lack of accurate information, limited\ncomputing power, and sub-optimal choices. This retreat from behavioral\nperfectionism in the literature, however, was typically accompanied by a\nconceptual modification of WE. Here, we show that giving up perfect rationality\nneed not force a departure from WE. On the contrary, WE can be reached with\nglobal stability in a routing game played by boundedly rational travelers. We\nachieve this result by developing a day-to-day (DTD) dynamical model that\nmimics how travelers gradually adjust their route valuations, hence choice\nprobabilities, based on past experiences. Our model, called cumulative logit\n(CumLog), resembles the classical DTD models but makes a crucial change:\nwhereas the classical models assume routes are valued based on the cost\naveraged over historical data, ours values the routes based on the cost\naccumulated. To describe route choice behaviors, the CumLog model only uses two\nparameters, one accounting for the rate at which the future route cost is\ndiscounted in the valuation relative to the past ones and the other describing\nthe sensitivity of route choice probabilities to valuation differences. We\nprove tha CumLog always converges to WE, regardless of the initial point, as\nlong as the behavioral parameters satisfy certain mild conditions. Our theory\nthus upholds WE's role as a benchmark in transportation systems analysis. It\nalso resolves the theoretical challenge posed by Harsanyi's instability problem\nby explaining why equally good routes at WE are selected with different\nprobabilities.",

The first objective of our study is to fill this gap. This\npaper analyzes the asymmetric duopoly model of Kopel analytically by using\nseveral tools based on symbolic computations. We discuss the possibility of the\nexistence of multiple positive equilibria and establish necessary and\nsufficient conditions for a given number of positive equilibria to exist. The\npossible positions of the equilibria in Kopel's model are also explored.\nFurthermore, in the asymmetric model of Kopel, if the duopolists adopt the best\nresponse reactions or homogeneous adaptive expectations, we establish rigorous\nconditions for the local stability of equilibria for the first time. The\noccurrence of chaos in Kopel's model seems to be supported by observations\nthrough numerical simulations, which, however, is challenging to prove\nrigorously. The second objective is to prove the existence of snapback\nrepellers in Kopel's map, which implies the existence of chaos in the sense of\nLi-Yorke according to Marotto's theorem.",

        "abstract": "\"Egyptian Ratscrew\" (ERS) is a modern American card game enjoyed by millions\nof players worldwide. A game of ERS is won by collecting all of the cards in\nthe deck. Typically this game is won by the player with the fastest reflexes,\nsince the most common strategy for collecting cards is being the first to slap\nthe pile in the center whenever legal combinations of cards are placed down.\nMost players assume that the dominant strategy is to develop a faster reaction\ntime than your opponents, and no academic inquiry has been levied against this\nassumption. This thesis investigates the hypothesis that a \"risk slapping\"\nstrategist who relies on practical economic decision making will win an\noverwhelming majority of games against players who rely on quick reflexes\nalone. It is theorized that this can be done by exploiting the \"burn rule,\" a\npenalty that is too low-cost to effectively dissuade players from slapping\nillegally when it benefits them. Using the Ruby programming language, we\nconstruct an Egyptian Ratscrew simulator from scratch. Our model allows us to\nsimulate the behavior of 8 strategically unique players within easily\nadjustable parameters including simulation type, player count, and burn amount.\nWe simulate 100k iterations of 67 different ERS games, totaling 6.7 million\ngames of ERS, and use win percentage data in order to determine which\nstrategies are dominant under each set of parameters. We then confirm our\nhypothesis that risk slapping is a dominant strategy, discover that there is no\nstrictly dominant approach to risk slapping, and elucidate a deeper\nunderstanding of different ERS mechanics such as the burn rule. Finally, we\nassess the implications of our findings and suggest potential improvements to\nthe rules of the game. We also touch on the real-world applications of our\nresearch and make recommendations for the future of Egyptian Ratscrew modeling.",

To address\nsuch a challenge, this paper proposes an array of viable heuristics of the\ndecision-making that drives those restoration campaigns. To examine their\napplicability and measure their performance, those heuristics have been applied\nto two real-work DCNs that consists of 100 listed Chinese A-share companies,\nwhose restoration has been modelled based on the 2021 financial data, in the\nwake of randomly generated default scenarios. The corresponding simulation\noutcome of the case-study shows that the restoration of the DCNs would be\nsignificantly influenced by the different heuristics adopted, and in\nparticular, the system-oriented heuristic is revealed to be significantly\noutperforming those individual corporation-oriented ones. Therefore, such a\nresearch has further highlighted that the interdependence-induced risk\npropagation shall be accounted for by the decision-makers, whereby a prompt and\neffective restoration campaign of DCNs could be shaped.",

        "abstract": "We readdress the problem of nonparametric statistical testing of random\nutility models proposed in Kitamura and Stoye (2018). Although their test is\nelegant, it is subject to computational constraints which leaves execution of\nthe test infeasible in many applications. We note that much of the\ncomputational burden in Kitamura and Stoye's test is due to their test defining\na polyhedral cone through its vertices rather than its faces. We propose an\nalternative but equivalent hypothesis test for random utility models. This test\nrelies on a series of equality and inequality constraints which defines the\nfaces of the corresponding polyhedral cone. Building on our testing procedure,\nwe develop a novel axiomatization of the random utility model. Our new axiom\ncan be interpreted as a condition on surplus allocation in cooperative games.",

We therefore develop a new version\nof the static approximate competitive equilibrium from carefully constructed\nrandom budgets which ensures that, in expectation, markets clear exactly. We\nthen use it to design the ``online combinatorial assignment mechanism'' (OCAM)\nwhich implements a DACEEI with high probability. The OCAM is (i)\ngroup-strategyproof up to one object (ii) envy-free up to one object for almost\nall agents (iii) approximately market-clearing in almost all periods with high\nprobability when the market is large and arrivals are random. Applications\ninclude refugee resettlement, daycare assignment, and airport slot allocation.",

However, there is little theoretical\nbacking for this claim, with existing evidence focused on case studies and\nsimulations. In this work, we prove that IRV has a moderating effect relative\nto plurality voting in a precise sense, developed in a 1-dimensional Euclidean\nmodel of voter preferences. We develop a theory of exclusion zones, derived\nfrom properties of the voter distribution, which serve to show how moderate and\nextreme candidates interact during IRV vote tabulation. The theory allows us to\nprove that if voters are symmetrically distributed and not too concentrated at\nthe extremes, IRV cannot elect an extreme candidate over a moderate. In\ncontrast, we show plurality can and validate our results computationally. Our\nmethods provide new frameworks for the analysis of voting systems, deriving\nexact winner distributions geometrically and establishing a connection between\nplurality voting and stick-breaking processes.",

This Article proposes a different and wholly novel reason\nthat the Chicago School is wrong: a fundamental assumption central to many of\nits game theory models has been disproven. This Article shows that a 2012\nbreakthrough from world famous physicist Freeman Dyson shocked the world of\ngame theory. This Article shows that Chicago School game theorists are wrong on\ntheir own terms because these 2 x 2 games such as the Prisoner's Dilemma,\nChicken, and Snowdrift, ostensibly based on mutual defection and corrective\njustice, in fact yield to an insight of pure cooperation. These new game theory\nsolutions can be scaled to design whole institutions and systems that honor the\npure cooperation insight, holding out the possibility of cracking large scale\nsocial dilemmas like the tragedy of the commons. It demonstrates that, in such\nsystems, pure cooperation is the best answer in the right environment and in\nthe long run.

First, as in constructive mathematics, the logic underlying\nproofs is intuitionistic. In a second sense of the word, ``constructive'' is\ntaken to mean ``built up from smaller components.'' Lotteries as well as\npreferences vary continuously over some topological space. The topology encodes\nobservability or verifiability restrictions -- the open sets of the topology\nserve as the possible truth values of assertions about preference and reflect\nconstraints on the ability to measure, deduce, or observe. Replacing an open\nset by a covering of smaller open sets serves as a notion of refinement of\ninformation. Within this framework, inability to compare arises as a phenomenon\ndistinct from indifference and this gives rise to the constructive failure of\nthe classical expected utility theorem. A constructive version of the theorem\nis then proved, and accomplishes several things. First, the representation\ntheorem uses continuous real-valued functions as indicators of preference for\nvariable lotteries and these functions reflect the inability to compare\nphenomenon. Second, conditions are provided whereby local representations of\npreference over open sets can be collated to provide a global representation.\nThird, the proofs are constructive and do not use the law of the excluded\nmiddle, which may not hold for variable lotteries. Fourth, a version of the\nclassical theorem is obtained by imposing a condition on the collection of open\nsets of the topology which has the effect of making the logic classical.",

We also provide succinct\nexpressions to quantify the optimality gap of any surplus function, based on\nits concave biconjugate. This new framework complements the current literature\nin two ways: invention of a new toolset; understanding affine contracts'\nperformance in a larger landscape. Our results also shed light on the technical\nroots of this question: why are there more positive results in the recent\nliterature that show simple contracts' optimality in robust settings rather\nthan stochastic settings? This phenomenon is related to two technical facts:\nthe sum of quasi-concave functions is not quasi-concave, and the maximization\nand expectation operators do not commute.",

Equilibrium analysis of the induced game predicts a reversion to\nrepeated static Nash pricing. When implemented in a reinforcement learning\nframework, it provides substantial reductions in prices (reducing markups by\n40% or more), without affecting product variety or requiring the platform to\nmake any payments on path. This mechanism applies to both the sale of\ndifferentiated goods on platforms, and the sale of homogeneous goods through\ndirect sales. The mechanism operates purely off-path, thereby inducing no\nwelfare losses in practice, and does not depend on the choice of discount\nfactors.",

The agent makes use of Bayesian\nlearning in order to estimate the institution's true trustworthiness and makes\nthe decision to place trust based on myopic rationality. Using elements from\nrandom walk theory, we explicitly derive the probability that such an agent\nceases placing trust at some point in the relationship, as well as the expected\ntime spent placing trust conditioned on their discontinuation thereof.\n  We then continue by modelling two truster agents, each in their own\nrelationship to the institution. We consider two natural models of\ncommunication between them. In the first (``observable rewards'') agents\ndisclose their experiences with the institution with one another, while in the\nsecond (``observable actions'') agents merely witness the actions of their\nneighbour, i.e., placing or not placing trust. Under the same assumptions as in\nthe single agent case, we describe the evolution of the beliefs of agents under\nthese two different communication models. Both the probability of ceasing to\nplace trust and the expected time in the system elude explicit expressions,\ndespite there being only two agents. We therefore conduct a simulation study in\norder to compare the effect of the different kinds of communication on the\ntrust dynamics.\n  We find that a pair of agents in both communication models has a greater\nchance of learning the true trustworthiness of an institution than a single\nagent. Communication between agents promotes the formation of long term trust\nwith a trustworthy institution as well as the timely exit from a trust\nrelationship with an untrustworthy institution. Contrary to what one might\nexpect, we find that having less information (observing each other's actions\ninstead of experiences) can sometimes be beneficial to the agents.",

Building upon the so-called\ndynamic programming approach in Cvitani\\'c, Possama\\\"i, and Touzi [18] and the\nrecently available results in Hern\\'andez and Possama\\\"i [43], we present a\nmethodology that covers the previous contracting problem. Our main contribution\nconsists in a characterisation of the moral hazard problem faced by the\nprincipal. In particular, it shows that under relatively mild technical\nconditions on the data of the problem, the supremum of the principal's expected\nutility over a smaller restricted family of contracts is equal to the supremum\nover all feasible contracts. Nevertheless, this characterisation yields, as far\nas we know, a novel class of control problems that involve the control of a\nforward Volterra equation via Volterra-type controls, and infinite-dimensional\nstochastic target constraints. Despite the inherent challenges associated to\nsuch a problem, we study the solution under three different specifications of\nutility functions for both the agent and the principal, and draw qualitative\nimplications from the form of the optimal contract. The general case remains\nthe subject of future research.",

        "abstract": "In decentralized finance (\"DeFi\"), automated market makers (AMMs) enable\ntraders to programmatically exchange one asset for another. Such trades are\nenabled by the assets deposited by liquidity providers (LPs). The goal of this\npaper is to characterize and interpret the optimal (i.e., profit-maximizing)\nstrategy of a monopolist liquidity provider, as a function of that LP's beliefs\nabout asset prices and trader behavior. We introduce a general framework for\nreasoning about AMMs based on a Bayesian-like belief inference framework, where\nLPs maintain an asset price estimate. In this model, the market maker (i.e.,\nLP) chooses a demand curve that specifies the quantity of a risky asset to be\nheld at each dollar price. Traders arrive sequentially and submit a price bid\nthat can be interpreted as their estimate of the risky asset price; the AMM\nresponds to this submitted bid with an allocation of the risky asset to the\ntrader, a payment that the trader must pay, and a revised internal estimate for\nthe true asset price. We define an incentive-compatible (IC) AMM as one in\nwhich a trader's optimal strategy is to submit its true estimate of the asset\nprice, and characterize the IC AMMs as those with downward-sloping demand\ncurves and payments defined by a formula familiar from Myerson's optimal\nauction theory. We generalize Myerson's virtual values, and characterize the\nprofit-maximizing IC AMM. The optimal demand curve generally has a jump that\ncan be interpreted as a \"bid-ask spread,\" which we show is caused by a\ncombination of adverse selection risk (dominant when the degree of information\nasymmetry is large) and monopoly pricing (dominant when asymmetry is small).\nThis work opens up new research directions into the study of automated exchange\nmechanisms from the lens of optimal auction theory and iterative belief\ninference, using tools of theoretical computer science in a novel way.",

In the context of collective\ndecision-making, this axiom is known as strategyproofness and turns out to be\nrather prohibitive, even when allowing for randomization. In particular,\nGibbard's random dictatorship theorem shows that only rather unattractive\nsocial decision schemes (SDSs) satisfy strategyproofness on the full domain of\npreferences. In this paper, we obtain more positive results by investigating\nstrategyproof SDSs on the Condorcet domain, which consists of all preference\nprofiles that admit a Condorcet winner. In more detail, we show that, if the\nnumber of voters $n$ is odd, every strategyproof and non-imposing SDS on the\nCondorcet domain can be represented as a mixture of dictatorial SDSs and the\nCondorcet rule (which chooses the Condorcet winner with probability $1$).\nMoreover, we prove that the Condorcet domain is a maximal connected domain that\nallows for attractive strategyproof SDSs if $n$ is odd as only random\ndictatorships are strategyproof and non-imposing on any sufficiently connected\nsuperset of it. We also derive analogous results for even $n$ by slightly\nextending the Condorcet domain. Finally, we also characterize the set of\ngroup-strategyproof and non-imposing SDSs on the Condorcet domain and its\nsupersets. These characterizations strengthen Gibbard's random dictatorship\ntheorem and establish that the Condorcet domain is essentially a maximal domain\nthat allows for attractive strategyproof SDSs.",

A warning\nto commitment optimizers, the risk these findings indicate appears to be\nalleviated to some extent by a strict information advantage the manipulations\nrely on.

In this paper, we\nstudy the manipulation problem with this information advantage relaxed. We\nconsider the scenario where the follower is not given any information about the\nleader's payoffs to begin with but has to learn to manipulate by interacting\nwith the leader. The follower can gather necessary information by querying the\nleader's optimal commitments against contrived best-response behaviors. Our\nresults indicate that the information advantage is not entirely indispensable\nto the follower's manipulations: the follower can learn the optimal way to\nmanipulate in polynomial time with polynomially many queries of the leader's\noptimal commitment.",

Consequently, a\ncomplementary relationship between the circumstances one inherits and the\nreturns to education she expects can be observed. This paper is an attempt to\nlook at this complementarity on the basis of theoretical logic and empirical\ninvestigation, which enables us to unearth the origin of inter-group disparity\nin educational participation, as is existed across the groups defined by taking\ncaste and gender together in Indian society. Furthermore, in the second piece\nof analysis, we assess the discrimination in the likelihood of educational\nparticipation by invoking the method of decomposition of disparity in the\nlikelihood of educational participation applicable in the logistic regression\nmodels, which enables us to re-establish the earlier mentioned complementary\nrelationship.",

        "abstract": "Throughout the food supply chain, between production, transportation,\npackaging, and green employment, a plethora of indicators cover the\nenvironmental footprint and resource use. By defining and tracking the more\ninefficient practices of the food supply chain and their effects, we can better\nunderstand how to improve agricultural performance, track nutrition values, and\nfocus on the reduction of a major risk to the environment while contributing to\nfood security. Our aim is to propose a framework for a food supply chain,\ndevoted to the vision of zero waste and zero emissions, and at the same time,\nfulfilling the broad commitment on inclusive green economy within the climate\naction. To set the groundwork for a smart city solution which achieves this\nvision, main indicators and evaluation frameworks are introduced, followed by\nthe drill down into most crucial problems, both globally and locally, in a case\nstudy in north Italy. Methane is on the rise in the climate agenda, and\nspecifically in Italy emission mitigation is difficult to achieve in the\nfarming sector. Accordingly, going from the generic frameworks towards a\nfederation deployment, we provide the reasoning for a cost-effective use case\nin the domain of food, to create a valuable digital twin. A Bayesian approach\nto assess use cases and select preferred scenarios is proposed, realizing the\npotential of the digital twin flexibility with FAIR data, while understanding\nand acting to achieve environmental and social goals, i.e., coping\nuncertainties, and combining green employment and food security. The proposed\nframework can be adjusted to organizational, financial, and political\nconsiderations in different locations worldwide, rethinking the value of\ninformation in the context of FAIR data in digital twins.",

        "abstract": "After a decade of on-demand mobility services that change spatial behaviors\nin metropolitan areas, the Shared Autonomous Vehicle (SAV) service is expected\nto increase traffic congestion and unequal access to transport services. A\nparadigm of scheduled supply that is aware of demand but not on-demand is\nproposed, introducing coordination and social and behavioral understanding,\nurban cognition and empowerment of agents, into a novel informational\nframework. Daily routines and other patterns of spatial behaviors outline a\nfundamental demand layer in a supply-oriented paradigm that captures urban\ndynamics and spatial-temporal behaviors, mostly in groups. Rather than\nreal-time requests and instant responses that reward unplanned actions, and\nbeyond just reservation of travels in timetables, the intention is to capture\nmobility flows in scheduled travels along the day considering time of day,\nplaces, passengers etc. Regulating goal-directed behaviors and caring for\nservice resources and the overall system welfare is proposed to minimize\nuncertainty, considering the capacity of mobility interactions to hold value,\ni.e., Motility as a Service (MaaS). The principal-agent problem in the smart\ncity is a problem of collective action among service providers and users that\ncreate expectations based on previous actions and reactions in mutual systems.\nPlanned behavior that accounts for service coordination is expected to\nstabilize excessive rides and traffic load, and to induce a cognitive gain,\nthus balancing information load and facilitating cognitive effort.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms are increasingly employed to price or value homes\nfor sale, properties for rent, rides for hire, and various other goods and\nservices. Machine learning-based prices are typically generated by complex\nalgorithms trained on historical sales data. However, displaying these prices\nto consumers anchors the realized sales prices, which will in turn become\ntraining samples for future iterations of the algorithms. The economic\nimplications of this machine learning \"feedback loop\" - an indirect\nhuman-algorithm interaction - remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we\ndevelop an analytical model of machine learning feedback loops in the context\nof the housing market. We show that feedback loops lead machine learning\nalgorithms to become overconfident in their own accuracy (by underestimating\nits error), and leads home sellers to over-rely on possibly erroneous\nalgorithmic prices. As a consequence at the feedback loop equilibrium, sale\nprices can become entirely erratic (relative to true consumer preferences in\nabsence of ML price interference). We then identify conditions (choice of ML\nmodels, seller characteristics and market characteristics) where the economic\npayoffs for home sellers at the feedback loop equilibrium is worse off than no\nmachine learning. We also empirically validate primitive building blocks of our\nanalytical model using housing market data from Zillow. We conclude by\nprescribing algorithmic corrective strategies to mitigate the effects of\nmachine learning feedback loops, discuss the incentives for platforms to adopt\nthese strategies, and discuss the role of policymakers in regulating the same.",

By establishing a multi-task contest model with\nheterogeneous competitor costs, this paper shows that after expanding the new\ncompetition dimension, competitors will choose the dimension with greater\nrelative comparative advantage rather than absolute advantage and pay more\neffort, which eventually leads to competitors choosing higher effort levels in\nboth the original dimension and the extended dimension.

The intrinsic fitness values correspond to scaling\ncoefficients needed to make a latent mutual matrix bi-stochastic, where the\nlatent scores can be interpreted as a-priori probabilities of a pair being\nmatched. Second, in every stable (or even approximately stable) matching, the\nwelfare or the ranks of the agents on each side of the market, when scaled by\ntheir intrinsic fitness, have an approximately exponential empirical\ndistribution. Moreover, the average welfare of agents on one side of the market\nis sufficient to determine the average on the other side.

However, game-theoretic predictions are\nbased on the assumption that agents are fully rational and believe in\nequilibrium plays, which unfortunately are mostly not true when human decision\nmakers are involved. To address this limitation, a number of behavioral\ngame-theoretic models are defined to account for the limited rationality of\nhuman decision makers. The \"quantal cognitive hierarchy\" (QCH) model, which is\none of the more recent models, is demonstrated to be the state-of-art model for\npredicting human behaviors in normal-form games. The QCH model assumes that\nagents in games can be both non-strategic (level-0) and strategic (level-$k$).\nFor level-0 agents, they choose their strategies irrespective of other agents.\nFor level-$k$ agents, they assume that other agents would be behaving at levels\nless than $k$ and best respond against them. However, an important assumption\nof the QCH model is that the distribution of agents' levels follows a Poisson\ndistribution. In this paper, we relax this assumption and design a\nlearning-based method at the population level to iteratively estimate the\nempirical distribution of agents' reasoning levels. By using a real-world\ndataset from the Swedish lowest unique positive integer game, we demonstrate\nhow our refined QCH model and the iterative solution-seeking process can be\nused in providing a more accurate behavioral model for agents. This leads to\nbetter performance in fitting the real data and allows us to track an agent's\nprogress in learning to play strategically over multiple rounds.",

        "abstract": "Winning the coin toss at the end of a tied soccer game gives a team the right\nto choose whether to kick either first or second on all five rounds of penalty\nkicks, when each team is allowed one kick per round. There is considerable\nevidence that the right to make this choice, which is usually to kick first,\ngives a team a significant advantage. To make the outcome of a tied game\nfairer, we suggest a rule that handicaps the team that kicks first (A),\nrequiring it to succeed on one more penalty kick than the team that kicks\nsecond (B). We call this the $m - n$ rule and, more specifically, propose $(m,\nn)$ = (5, 4): For A to win, it must successfully kick 5 goals before the end of\nthe round in which B kicks its 4th; for B to win, it must succeed on 4 penalty\nkicks before A succeeds on 5. If both teams reach (5, 4) on the same round --\nwhen they both kick successfully at (4, 3) -- then the game is decided by\nround-by-round \"sudden death,\" whereby the winner is the first team to score in\na subsequent round when the other team does not. We show that this rule is fair\nin tending to equalize the ability of each team to win a tied game in a penalty\nshootout. We also discuss a related rule that precludes the teams from reaching\n(5, 4) at the same time, obviating the need for sudden death and extra rounds.",

Our mechanism stands\nout from the classical contract theory-based truthful mechanisms as it empowers\nagents to make their own decisions about their level of involvement, making it\nmore practical for many real-world task allocation scenarios. It has been\nproven that by considering a linear form of incentive function consisting of\ntwo decision functions for the task publisher the mechanism's goals are met.\nThe proposed truthful mechanism is initially modeled as a non-convex functional\noptimization with the double continuum of constraints, nevertheless, we\ndemonstrate that by deriving an equivalent form of the incentive constraints,\nit can be reformulated as a tractable convex optimal control problem.

Because a pentaform is a set, this paper can\nexplicitly partition the game form into piece forms, each of which starts at a\n(Selten) subroot and contains all subsequent nodes except those that follow a\nsubsequent subroot. Then the set of subroots becomes the domain of a value\nfunction, and the piece-form partition becomes the framework for a value\nrecursion which generalizes the Bellman equation from dynamic programming. The\nmain results connect the value recursion with the subgame-perfect equilibria of\nthe original game, under the assumptions of upper- and lower-convergence.\nFinally, a corollary characterizes subgame perfection as the absence of an\nimproving one-piece deviation.",

        "abstract": "Auto-bidding has recently become a popular feature in ad auctions. This\nfeature enables advertisers to simply provide high-level constraints and goals\nto an automated agent, which optimizes their auction bids on their behalf. In\nthis paper, we examine the effect of different auctions on the incentives of\nadvertisers to report their constraints to the auto-bidder intermediaries. More\nprecisely, we study whether canonical auctions such as first price auction\n(FPA) and second price auction (SPA) are auto-bidding incentive compatible\n(AIC): whether an advertiser can gain by misreporting their constraints to the\nautobidder.\n  We consider value-maximizing advertisers in two important settings: when they\nhave a budget constraint and when they have a target cost-per-acquisition\nconstraint. The main result of our work is that for both settings, FPA and SPA\nare not AIC. This contrasts with FPA being AIC when auto-bidders are\nconstrained to bid using a (sub-optimal) uniform bidding policy. We further\nextend our main result and show that any (possibly randomized) auction that is\ntruthful (in the classic profit-maximizing sense), scalar invariant and\nsymmetric is not AIC. Finally, to complement our findings, we provide\nsufficient market conditions for FPA and SPA to become AIC for two advertisers.\nThese conditions require advertisers' valuations to be well-aligned. This\nsuggests that when the competition is intense for all queries, advertisers have\nless incentive to misreport their constraints.\n  From a methodological standpoint, we develop a novel continuous model of\nqueries. This model provides tractability to study equilibrium with\nauto-bidders, which contrasts with the standard discrete query model, which is\nknown to be hard. Through the analysis of this model, we uncover a surprising\nresult: in auto-bidding with two advertisers, FPA and SPA are auction\nequivalent.",

        "abstract": "Over the past few years, more and more Internet advertisers have started\nusing automated bidding for optimizing their advertising campaigns. Such\nadvertisers have an optimization goal (e.g. to maximize conversions), and some\nconstraints (e.g. a budget or an upper bound on average cost per conversion),\nand the automated bidding system optimizes their auction bids on their behalf.\nOften, these advertisers participate on multiple advertising channels and try\nto optimize across these channels. A central question that remains unexplored\nis how automated bidding affects optimal auction design in the multi-channel\nsetting.\n  In this paper, we study the problem of setting auction reserve prices in the\nmulti-channel setting. In particular, we shed light on the revenue implications\nof whether each channel optimizes its reserve price locally, or whether the\nchannels optimize them globally to maximize total revenue. Motivated by\npractice, we consider two models: one in which the channels have full freedom\nto set reserve prices, and another in which the channels have to respect floor\nprices set by the publisher. We show that in the first model, welfare and\nrevenue loss from local optimization is bounded by a function of the\nadvertisers' inputs, but is independent of the number of channels and bidders.\nIn stark contrast, we show that the revenue from local optimization could be\narbitrarily smaller than those from global optimization in the second model.",

In response to such practices, recent proposed\nregulations aim to increase transparency, especially in digital markets. In\norder to understand when opacity arises in contracting and the potential\neffects of proposed regulations, we study a moral hazard model in which a\nrisk-neutral principal faces a continuum of weakly risk-averse agents. The\nagents differ in an observable characteristic that affects the payoff of the\nprincipal. In a described contract, the principal sorts the agents into groups,\nand to each group communicates a distribution of output-contingent payments.\nWithin each group, the realized distribution of payments must be consistent\nwith the communicated contract. A described contract is transparent if the\nprincipal communicates the realized contract to the agent ex-ante, and\notherwise it is opaque. We provide a geometric characterization of the\nprincipal's optimal described contract as well as conditions under which the\noptimal described mechanism is transparent and opaque. We apply our results to\nthe design and description of driver payment schemes on ride-hailing platforms.",

        "abstract": "Modern blockchains guarantee that submitted transactions will be included\neventually; a property formally known as liveness. But financial activity\nrequires transactions to be included in a timely manner. Unfortunately,\nclassical liveness is not strong enough to guarantee this, particularly in the\npresence of a motivated adversary who benefits from censoring transactions. We\ndefine censorship resistance as the amount it would cost the adversary to\ncensor a transaction for a fixed interval of time as a function of the\nassociated tip. This definition has two advantages, first it captures the fact\nthat transactions with a higher miner tip can be more costly to censor, and\ntherefore are more likely to swiftly make their way onto the chain. Second, it\napplies to a finite time window, so it can be used to assess whether a\nblockchain is capable of hosting financial activity that relies on timely\ninclusion.\n  We apply this definition in the context of auctions. Auctions are a building\nblock for many financial applications, and censoring competing bids offers an\neasy-to-model motivation for our adversary. Traditional proof-of-stake\nblockchains have poor enough censorship resistance that it is difficult to\nretain the integrity of an auction when bids can only be submitted in a single\nblock. As the number of bidders $n$ in a single block auction increases, the\nprobability that the winner is not the adversary, and the economic efficiency\nof the auction, both decrease faster than $1/n$. Running the auction over\nmultiple blocks, each with a different proposer, alleviates the problem only if\nthe number of blocks grows faster than the number of bidders. We argue that\nblockchains with more than one concurrent proposer have can have strong\ncensorship resistance. We achieve this by setting up a prisoner's dilemma among\nthe proposers using conditional tips.",

Examples include assigning jobs to busy servers, students to\ncrowded schools or crowded classes, commuters to congested routes, workers to\ncrowded office spaces or to team projects etc... Congestion is anonymous (it\nonly depends on the number n of agents in a given post). A canonical\ninterpretation of ex ante fairness allows each agent to choose m post-specific\ncaps on the congestion they tolerate: these requests are mutually feasible if\nand only if the sum of the caps is n. For ex post fairness we impose a\ncompetitive requirement close to envy freeness: taking the congestion profile\nas given each agent is assigned to one of her best posts. If a competitive\nassignment exists, it delivers unique congestion and welfare profiles and is\nalso efficient and ex ante fair. In a fractional (randomised or time sharing)\nversion of our model, a unique competitive congestion profile always exists. It\nis approximately implemented by a mixture of ex post deterministic assignments:\nwith an approxination factor equal to the largest utility loss from one more\nunit of congestion, the latter deliver identical welfare profiles and are\nweakly efficient. Our approach to ex ante fairness generalises to the model\nwhere each agent's congestion is weighted. Now the caps on posts depend only\nupon own weight and total congestion, not on the number of other agents\ncontributing to it. Remarkably in both models these caps are feasible if and\nonly if they give to each agent the right to veto all but (1/m) of their\nfeasible allocations.",

For multidimensional spaces of\nagents and products, Rochet and Chon\\'e (1998) reformulated this problem to a\nconcave maximization over the set of convex functions, by assuming agent\npreferences combine bilinearity in the product and agent parameters with a\nquasilinear sensitivity to prices. We characterize solutions to this problem by\nidentifying a dual minimization problem. This duality allows us to reduce the\nsolution of the square example of Rochet-Chon\\'e to a novel free boundary\nproblem, giving the first analytical description of an overlooked market\nsegment.",

        "title": "Auctions without commitment in the auto-bidding world",
        "abstract": "Advertisers in online ad auctions are increasingly using auto-bidding\nmechanisms to bid into auctions instead of directly bidding their value\nmanually. One prominent auto-bidding format is the target cost-per-acquisition\n(tCPA) which maximizes the volume of conversions subject to a\nreturn-of-investment constraint. From an auction theoretic perspective however,\nthis trend seems to go against foundational results that postulate that for\nprofit-maximizing bidders, it is optimal to use a classic bidding system like\nmarginal CPA (mCPA) bidding rather than using strategies like tCPA.\n  In this paper we rationalize the adoption of such seemingly sub-optimal\nbidding within the canonical quasi-linear framework. The crux of the argument\nlies in the notion of commitment. We consider a multi-stage game where first\nthe auctioneer declares the auction rules; then bidders select either the tCPA\nor mCPA bidding format and then, if the auctioneer lacks commitment, it can\nrevisit the rules of the auction (e.g., may readjust reserve prices depending\non the observed bids). Our main result is that so long as a bidder believes\nthat the auctioneer lacks commitment to follow the rule of the declared auction\nthen the bidder will make a higher profit by choosing the tCPA format over the\nmCPA format.\n  We then explore the commitment consequences for the auctioneer. In a\nsimplified version of the model where there is only one bidder, we show that\nthe tCPA subgame admits a credible equilibrium while the mCPA format does not.\nThat is, when the bidder chooses the tCPA format the auctioneer can credibly\nimplement the auction rules announced at the beginning of the game. We also\nshow that, under some mild conditions, the auctioneer's revenue is larger when\nthe bidder uses the tCPA format rather than mCPA. We further quantify the value\nfor the auctioneer to be able to commit to the declared auction rules.",

Specifically, in the first model, the parameter region for the stability\nof any periodic orbit with a fixed order constitutes a connected set. In the\nsecond model, however, the stability regions for the 3-cycle, 4-cycle, and\n5-cycle orbits are disconnected sets formed by many disjoint portions.\nFurthermore, we find that the basins of the two stable equilibria in the second\nmodel are disconnected and also have complicated topological structures.

This finding could be conducive to the revelation of the essential\ndifference between dynamic Cournot and Bertrand oligopolies with differentiated\ngoods.

To address the research\ngap regarding models that combine equivalent exchange and redistribution, this\nstudy compares an equivalent market exchange with redistribution based on power\ncenters and a nonequivalent exchange with mutual aid using the Polanyi,\nGraeber, and Karatani modes of exchange. Two new exchange models based on\nmulti-agent interactions are reconstructed following an econophysics approach\nfor evaluating the Gini index (inequality) and total exchange (economic flow).\nExchange simulations indicate that the evaluation parameter of the total\nexchange divided by the Gini index can be expressed by the same saturated\ncurvilinear approximate equation using the wealth transfer rate and time period\nof redistribution and the surplus contribution rate of the wealthy and the\nsaving rate. However, considering the coercion of taxes and its associated\ncosts and independence based on the morality of mutual aid, a nonequivalent\nexchange without return obligation is preferred. This is oriented toward\nGraeber's baseline communism and Karatani's mode of exchange D, with\nimplications for alternatives to the capitalist economy.",

        "abstract": "We explore the implications of a preference ordering for an investor-consumer\nwith a strong preference for keeping consumption above an exogenous social\nnorm, but who is willing to tolerate occasional dips below it. We do this by\nsplicing two CRRA preference orderings, one with high curvature below the norm\nand the other with low curvature at or above it. We find this formulation\nappealing for many endowment funds and sovereign wealth funds, including the\nNorwegian Government Pension Fund Global, which inspired our research. We solve\nthis model analytically as well as numerically and find that annual spending\nshould not only be significantly lower than the expected financial return, but\nmostly also procyclical. In particular, financial losses should, as a rule, be\nfollowed by larger than proportional spending cuts, except when some smoothing\nis needed to keep spending from falling too far below the social norm. Yet, at\nvery low wealth levels, spending should be kept particularly low in order to\nbuild sufficient wealth to raise consumption above the social norm. Financial\nrisk taking should also be modest and procyclical, so that the investor\nsometimes may want to \"buy at the top\" and \"sell at the bottom\". Many of these\nfeatures are shared by habitformation models and other models with some lower\nbound for consumption. However, our specification is more flexible and thus\nmore easily adaptable to actual fund management. The nonlinearity of the policy\nfunctions may present challenges regarding delegation to professional managers.\nHowever, simpler rules of thumb with constant or slowly moving equity share and\nconsumption-wealth ratio can reach almost the same expected discounted utility.\nHowever, the constant levels will then look very different from the\nimplications of expected CRRA utility or Epstein-Zin preferences in that\nconsumption is much lower.",

Our metrics are designed to\ncapture the complexity of various structural (rather than computational)\nconcerns, in particular ones of recent interest within economics. We consider a\nunified, flexible approach to formalizing our questions: Define a protocol or\ndata structure performing some task, and bound the number of bits that it\nrequires. Our main results apply this approach to four questions of general\ninterest; for mechanisms matching applicants to institutions, our questions\nare:\n  (1) How can one applicant affect the outcome matching?\n  (2) How can one applicant affect another applicant's set of options?\n  (3) How can the outcome matching be represented / communicated?\n  (4) How can the outcome matching be verified?\n  Holistically, our results show that TTC is more complex than DA, formalizing\nprevious intuitions that DA has a simpler structure than TTC. For question (2),\nour result gives a new combinatorial characterization of which institutions are\nremoved from each applicant's set of options when a new applicant is added in\nDA; this characterization may be of independent interest. For question (3), our\nresult gives new tight lower bounds proving that the relationship between the\nmatching and the priorities is more complex in TTC than in DA. We nonetheless\nshowcase that this higher complexity of TTC is nuanced: By constructing new\ntight lower-bound instances and new verification protocols, we prove that DA\nand TTC are comparable in complexity under questions (1) and (4). This more\nprecisely delineates the ways in which TTC is more complex than DA, and\nemphasizes that diverse considerations must factor into gauging the complexity\nof matching mechanisms.",

In this paper,\nwe transfer recent developments from abstract decision theory with incomplete\npreferential and probabilistic information to this multi-target setting and\nshow how -- by exploiting the (potentially) partial cardinal and partial\nprobabilistic information -- more informative orders for comparing decisions\ncan be given than the Pareto order.

        "abstract": "Results from the communication complexity literature have demonstrated that\nstable matching requires communication: one cannot find or verify a stable\nmatch without having access to essentially all of the ordinal preference\ninformation held privately by the agents in the market. Stated differently,\nthese results show that stable matching mechanisms are not robust to even a\nsmall number of labeled inaccuracies in the input preferences. In practice,\nthese results indicate that agents must go through the time-intensive process\nof accurately ranking each and every potential match candidate if they wish for\nthe resulting match to be guaranteedly stable. Thus, in large markets,\ncommunication requirements for stable matching may be impractically high.\n  A natural question to ask, given this result, is whether some higher-order\nstructure in the market can indicate which large markets have steeper\ncommunication requirements. In this paper, we perform such an analysis in a\nregime where agents have a utility-based notion of preference. We consider a\ndynamic model where agents only have access to an approximation of their\nutility that satisfies a universal multiplicative error bound. We apply\nguarantees from the theoretical computer science literature on low-distortion\nembeddings of finite metric spaces to understand the communication requirements\nof stable matching in large markets in terms of their structural properties.\nOur results show that for a broad family of markets, the error bound may not\ngrow faster than $n^2\\log(n)$ while maintaining a deterministic guarantee on\nthe behavior of stable matching mechanisms in the limit. We also show that a\nstronger probabilistic guarantee may be made so long as the bound grows at most\nlogarithmically in the underlying topological complexity of the market.",

Our work therefore turns to a more ambitious\nnotion of \\emph{dynamic benchmark consistency}, which guarantees the\nperformance of the best \\emph{dynamic} sequence of actions, selected in\nhindsight subject to a constraint on the allowable number of action changes.\nOur main result establishes that for any joint empirical distribution of play\nthat may arise when all players deploy no-regret strategies, there exist\ndynamic benchmark consistent strategies such that if all players deploy these\nstrategies the same empirical distribution emerges when the horizon is large\nenough. This result demonstrates that although dynamic benchmark consistent\nstrategies have a different algorithmic structure and provide significantly\nenhanced individual assurances, they lead to the same equilibrium set as\nno-regret strategies.

Each agent desires\nthe good and uses it to create value for the principal. We designate this value\nas the agent's private type. Even though the principal does not know the\nagents' types, she can verify them at a cost. The allocation of the good thus\ndepends on the agents' self-declared types and the results of any verification\nperformed, and the principal's payoff matches her value of the allocation minus\nthe costs of verification. It is known that if the agents' types are\nindependent, then a favored-agent mechanism maximizes her expected payoff.\nHowever, this result relies on the unrealistic assumptions that the agents'\ntypes follow known independent probability distributions. In contrast, we\nassume here that the agents' types are governed by an ambiguous joint\nprobability distribution belonging to a commonly known ambiguity set and that\nthe principal maximizes her worst-case expected payoff. We study support-only\nambiguity sets, which contain all distributions supported on a rectangle,\nMarkov ambiguity sets, which contain all distributions in a support-only\nambiguity set satisfying some first-order moment bounds, and Markov ambiguity\nsets with independent types, which contain all distributions in a Markov\nambiguity set under which the agents' types are mutually independent.

        "abstract": "Zero-sum stochastic games have found important applications in a variety of\nfields, from machine learning to economics. Work on this model has primarily\nfocused on the computation of Nash equilibrium due to its effectiveness in\nsolving adversarial board and video games. Unfortunately, a Nash equilibrium is\nnot guaranteed to exist in zero-sum stochastic games when the payoffs at each\nstate are not convex-concave in the players' actions. A Stackelberg\nequilibrium, however, is guaranteed to exist. Consequently, in this paper, we\nstudy zero-sum stochastic Stackelberg games. Going beyond known existence\nresults for (non-stationary) Stackelberg equilibria, we prove the existence of\nrecursive (i.e., Markov perfect) Stackelberg equilibria (recSE) in these games,\nprovide necessary and sufficient conditions for a policy profile to be a recSE,\nand show that recSE can be computed in (weakly) polynomial time via value\niteration. Finally, we show that zero-sum stochastic Stackelberg games can\nmodel the problem of pricing and allocating goods across agents and time. More\nspecifically, we propose a zero-sum stochastic Stackelberg game whose recSE\ncorrespond to the recursive competitive equilibria of a large class of\nstochastic Fisher markets. We close with a series of experiments that showcase\nhow our methodology can be used to solve the consumption-savings problem in\nstochastic Fisher markets.",

        "abstract": "Using simulations between pairs of $\\epsilon$-greedy q-learners with\none-period memory, this article demonstrates that the potential function of the\nstochastic replicator dynamics (Foster and Young, 1990) allows it to predict\nthe emergence of error-proof cooperative strategies from the underlying\nparameters of the repeated prisoner's dilemma. The observed cooperation rates\nbetween q-learners are related to the ratio between the kinetic energy exerted\nby the polar attractors of the replicator dynamics under the grim trigger\nstrategy. The frontier separating the parameter space conducive to cooperation\nfrom the parameter space dominated by defection can be found by setting the\nkinetic energy ratio equal to a critical value, which is a function of the\ndiscount factor, $f(\\delta) = \\delta/(1-\\delta)$, multiplied by a correction\nterm to account for the effect of the algorithms' exploration probability. The\ngradient at the frontier increases with the distance between the game\nparameters and the hyperplane that characterizes the incentive compatibility\nconstraint for cooperation under grim trigger.\n  Building on literature from the neurosciences, which suggests that\nreinforcement learning is useful to understanding human behavior in risky\nenvironments, the article further explores the extent to which the frontier\nderived for q-learners also explains the emergence of cooperation between\nhumans. Using metadata from laboratory experiments that analyze human choices\nin the infinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma, the cooperation rates between\nhumans are compared to those observed between q-learners under similar\nconditions. The correlation coefficients between the cooperation rates observed\nfor humans and those observed for q-learners are consistently above $0.8$. The\nfrontier derived from the simulations between q-learners is also found to\npredict the emergence of cooperation between humans.",

In particular, each voter can approve multiple parties and\neach party can be assigned multiple seats. Two central requirements in this\nsetting are proportional representation and strategyproofness. Intuitively,\nproportional representation requires that every sufficiently large group of\nvoters with similar preferences is represented in the committee.\nStrategyproofness demands that no voter can benefit by misreporting her true\npreferences. We show that these two axioms are incompatible for anonymous\nparty-approval multiwinner voting rules, thus proving a far-reaching\nimpossibility theorem. The proof of this result is obtained by formulating the\nproblem in propositional logic and then letting a SAT solver show that the\nformula is unsatisfiable. Additionally, we demonstrate how to circumvent this\nimpossibility by considering a weakening of strategy\\-proofness which requires\nthat only voters who do not approve any elected party cannot manipulate. While\nmost common voting rules fail even this weak notion of strategyproofness, we\ncharacterize Chamberlin--Courant approval voting within the class of Thiele\nrules based on this strategyproofness notion.",

The literature focuses on mechanisms with simple dominant strategies,\nbut many real-world applications lack dominant strategies, making the intensity\nof preferences between outcomes important for determining strategies. Even\nthough precise information about cardinal utilities is not available, some data\nabout the likelihood of utility functions is often accessible. We propose to\nuse Bayesian games to formalize uncertainty about the decision-makers'\nutilities by viewing them as a collection of normal-form games. Instead of\nsearching for the Bayes-Nash equilibrium, we study how uncertainty in utilities\nis reflected in uncertainty of strategic play. To do this, we introduce a novel\nsolution concept called $\\alpha$-Rank-collections, which extends $\\alpha$-Rank\nto Bayesian games. This allows us to analyze strategic play in, for example,\nnon-strategyproof matching markets, for which appropriate solution concepts are\ncurrently lacking. $\\alpha$-Rank-collections characterize the expected\nprobability of encountering a certain strategy profile under replicator\ndynamics in the long run, rather than predicting a specific equilibrium\nstrategy profile. We experimentally evaluate $\\alpha$-Rank-collections using\ninstances of the Boston mechanism, finding that our solution concept provides\nmore nuanced predictions compared to Bayes-Nash equilibria. Additionally, we\nprove that $\\alpha$-Rank-collections are invariant to positive affine\ntransformations, a standard property for a solution concept, and are efficient\nto approximate.",

The\nconventional technology of \"permissive meeting analysis\" derives a\nconsensusable choice that falls within everyone's permissible range through\nmathematical analyses; however, it tends to be biased toward the majority in a\ngroup, making it difficult to reach a consensus when a conflict arises. To\nsupport consensus building (defined here as an acceptable compromise that not\neveryone rejects), we developed a composite consensus-building process. The\ndeveloped process addresses this issue by combining permissible meeting\nanalysis with a new \"compromise choice-exploration\" technology, which presents\na consensusable choice that emphasizes fairness and equality among everyone\nwhen permissible meeting analysis fails to do so. When both permissible meeting\nanalysis and compromise choice exploration do not arrive at a consensus, a\nfacility is provided to create a sublated choice among those provided by them.\nThe trial experimental results confirmed that permissive meeting analysis and\ncompromise choice exploration are sufficiently useful for deriving\nconsensusable choices. Furthermore, we found that compromise choice exploration\nis characterized by its ability to derive choices that control the balance\nbetween compromise and fairness. Our proposed composite consensus-building\napproach could be applied in a wide range of situations, from local issues in\nmunicipalities and communities to international issues such as environmental\nprotection and human rights issues.

In such cases we explore appointing one or more chairs\n(judges) who determine the weight of each reviewer for aggregation, creating\nmultiple levels. However, these chairs may be unable to correctly identify the\ncompetence of the reviewers they oversee, and therefore unable to compute the\noptimal weighting.

        "abstract": "We study the hidden-action principal-agent problem in an online setting. In\neach round, the principal posts a contract that specifies the payment to the\nagent based on each outcome. The agent then makes a strategic choice of action\nthat maximizes her own utility, but the action is not directly observable by\nthe principal. The principal observes the outcome and receives utility from the\nagent's choice of action. Based on past observations, the principal dynamically\nadjusts the contracts with the goal of maximizing her utility.\n  We introduce an online learning algorithm and provide an upper bound on its\nStackelberg regret. We show that when the contract space is $[0,1]^m$, the\nStackelberg regret is upper bounded by $\\widetilde O(\\sqrt{m} \\cdot\nT^{1-1/(2m+1)})$, and lower bounded by $\\Omega(T^{1-1/(m+2)})$, where\n$\\widetilde O$ omits logarithmic factors. This result shows that\nexponential-in-$m$ samples are sufficient and necessary to learn a near-optimal\ncontract, resolving an open problem on the hardness of online contract design.\nMoreover, when contracts are restricted to some subset $\\mathcal{F} \\subset\n[0,1]^m$, we define an intrinsic dimension of $\\mathcal{F}$ that depends on the\ncovering number of the spherical code in the space and bound the regret in\nterms of this intrinsic dimension. When $\\mathcal{F}$ is the family of linear\ncontracts, we show that the Stackelberg regret grows exactly as\n$\\Theta(T^{2/3})$.\n  The contract design problem is challenging because the utility function is\ndiscontinuous. Bounding the discretization error in this setting has been an\nopen problem. In this paper, we identify a limited set of directions in which\nthe utility function is continuous, allowing us to design a new discretization\nmethod and bound its error. This approach enables the first upper bound with no\nrestrictions on the contract and action space.",

The paper identifies\ntwo simple families of scoring rules that guarantee constant approximations to\nthe optimal scoring rule. The truncated separate scoring rule is the sum of\nsingle dimensional scoring rules that is truncated to the bounded range of\nfeasible scores. The threshold scoring rule gives the maximum score if reports\nexceed a threshold and zero otherwise. Approximate optimality of one or the\nother of these rules is similar to the bundling or selling separately result of\nBabaioff, Immorlica, Lucier, and Weinberg (2014).

The main results of the paper show that an\narbitrage trade arises only when an agent updates his recursion of priors about\nthe strategies and beliefs employed by other market participants.

In this paper, we study the supply chain\ncontract design problem faced by a data-driven supplier who needs to respond to\nthe inventory decisions of the downstream retailer. Both the supplier and the\nretailer are uncertain about the market demand and need to learn about it\nsequentially. The goal for the supplier is to develop data-driven pricing\npolicies with sublinear regret bounds under a wide range of possible retailer\ninventory policies for a fixed time horizon.\n  To capture the dynamics induced by the retailer's learning policy, we first\nmake a connection to non-stationary online learning by following the notion of\nvariation budget. The variation budget quantifies the impact of the retailer's\nlearning strategy on the supplier's decision-making. We then propose dynamic\npricing policies for the supplier for both discrete and continuous demand. We\nalso note that our proposed pricing policy only requires access to the support\nof the demand distribution, but critically, does not require the supplier to\nhave any prior knowledge about the retailer's learning policy or the demand\nrealizations. We examine several well-known data-driven policies for the\nretailer, including sample average approximation, distributionally robust\noptimization, and parametric approaches, and show that our pricing policies\nlead to sublinear regret bounds in all these cases.\n  At the managerial level, we answer affirmatively that there is a pricing\npolicy with a sublinear regret bound under a wide range of retailer's learning\npolicies, even though she faces a learning retailer and an unknown demand\ndistribution. Our work also provides a novel perspective in data-driven\noperations management where the principal has to learn to react to the learning\npolicies employed by other agents in the system.",

The factors affecting the price of a financial position\ninclude not only market internal factors, but also other various market\nexternal factors.

Motivated by this observation, this\npaper aims to design a novel axiomatic approach to risk measures in random\nenvironments. We construct a new distortion-type risk measure, which can\nappropriately evaluate the risk of financial positions in the presence of\nenvironments. After having studied its fundamental properties, we also\naxiomatically characterize it by proposing a novel set of axioms. Furthermore,\nits coherence and dual representation are investigated. The new class of risk\nmeasures in random environments is rich enough, for example, it not only can\nrecover some known risk measures such as the common weighted value at risk and\nrange value at risk, but also can induce other new specific risk measures such\nas risk measures in the presence of background risk. Examples are given to\nillustrate the new framework of risk measures.

This captures the fact that when comparing two\nactions an agent should not care about payoffs in situations where they lead to\nidentical payoffs.\n  (ii) The well-known Leximin notion from social choice theory, which we apply\nfor robust decision-making. In particular, the leximin is always DSL but not\nvice-versa.\n  We study the relations of these notions to other robust notions, and\nillustrate the results of their use in auctions and other settings. Economic\ndesign aims to maximize social welfare when facing self-motivated participants.\nIn online environments, such as the Web, participants' incentives take a novel\nform originating from the lack of clear agent identity -- the ability to create\nSybil attacks, i.e., the ability of each participant to act using multiple\nidentities. It is well-known that Sybil attacks are a major obstacle for\nwelfare-maximization.

When final allocations are observed but agents' preferences are\nunknown, when might the allocation be in the core? This is a one-sided analogue\nof the model in Echenique, Lee, Shum, and Yenmez (2013). I build a model in\nwhich the strict core is testable -- an allocation is \"rationalizable\" if there\nis a preference profile putting it in the core. In this manner, I develop a\ntheory of the revealed preferences of one-sided matching. I study\nrationalizability in both non-transferrable and transferrable utility settings.\nIn the non-transferrable utility setting, an allocation is rationalizable if\nand only if: whenever agents with the same preferences are in the same\npotential trading cycle, they receive the same allocation. In the transferrable\nutility setting, an allocation is rationalizable if and only if: there exists a\nprice vector supporting the allocation as a competitive equilibrium; or\nequivalently, it satisfies a cyclic monotonicity condition. The proofs leverage\nsimple graph theory and combinatorial optimization and tie together classic\ntheories of consumer demand revealed preferences and competitive equilibrium.",

In this paper we note\nthat the information bottleneck principle may similarly be applied directly to\ncorporate hierarchies.

Recently, Holliday and Pacuit (Journal of\nTheoretical Politics 33 (2021) 475-524) axiomatically characterized the class\nof rules refined by one such cycle-resolving rule, dubbed Split Cycle: in each\nmajority cycle, discard the majority preferences with the smallest majority\nmargin. They showed that any rule satisfying five standard axioms plus a\nweakening of Arrow's Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA), called\nCoherent IIA, is refined by Split Cycle. In this paper, we go further and show\nthat Split Cycle is the only rule satisfying the axioms of Holliday and Pacuit\ntogether with two additional axioms, which characterize the class of rules that\nrefine Split Cycle: Coherent Defeat and Positive Involvement in Defeat.\nCoherent Defeat states that any majority preference not occurring in a cycle is\nretained, while Positive Involvement in Defeat is closely related to the\nwell-known axiom of Positive Involvement (as in J. Perez, Social Choice and\nWelfare 18 (2001) 601-616).

Even\nthough dealing with demand uncertainty in resource allocation problems has been\nthe topic of many papers in the literature, the challenge of not knowing\nrewards has been barely explored. The lack of knowledge about agents' rewards\nis inspired by the problem of allocating units of a new resource (e.g., newly\ndeveloped vaccines or drugs) with unknown effectiveness/value. For such\nsettings, we assume that we can \\emph{test} the market before the allocation\nperiod starts. During the test period, we sample each agent in the market with\nprobability $p$. We study how to optimally exploit the \\emph{sample\ninformation} in our online resource allocation problem under adversarial\narrival processes. We present an asymptotically optimal algorithm that achieves\n$1-\\Theta(1/(p\\sqrt{m}))$ competitive ratio, where $m$ is the number of\navailable units of the resource. By characterizing an upper bound on the\ncompetitive ratio of any randomized and deterministic algorithm, we show that\nour competitive ratio of $1-\\Theta(1/(p\\sqrt{m}))$ is tight for any $p\n=\\omega(1/\\sqrt{m})$. That asymptotic optimality is possible with sample\ninformation highlights the significant advantage of running a test period for\nnew resources. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm using a\ndataset that contains the number of COVID-19 related hospitalized patients\nacross different age groups.",

We consider two alternative versions of\nagenda manipulation-proofness for social welfare functions, that are\ndistinguished by `parallel' vs. `sequential' execution of agenda formation and\npreference elicitation, respectively. Under the `parallel' version, it is shown\nthat a large class of anonymous and idempotent social welfare functions that\nsatisfy both agenda manipulation-proofness and strategy-proofness on a natural\ndomain of single-peaked `meta-preferences' induced by arbitrary total\npreference preorders are indeed available. It is only under the second,\n`sequential' version that agenda manipulation-proofness on the same natural\ndomain of single-peaked `meta-preferences' is in fact shown to be tightly\nrelated to the classic Arrowian `independence of irrelevant alternatives' (IIA)\nfor social welfare functions. In particular, it is shown that using IIA to\nsecure such `sequential' version of agenda manipulation-proofness and combining\nit with a very minimal requirement of distributed responsiveness results in a\ncharacterization of the `global stalemate' social welfare function, the\nconstant function which invariably selects universal social indifference.

        "abstract": "Optimizing strategic decisions (a.k.a. computing equilibrium) is key to the\nsuccess of many non-cooperative multi-agent applications. However, in many\nreal-world situations, we may face the exact opposite of this game-theoretic\nproblem -- instead of prescribing equilibrium of a given game, we may directly\nobserve the agents' equilibrium behaviors but want to infer the underlying\nparameters of an unknown game. This research question, also known as inverse\ngame theory, has been studied in multiple recent works in the context of\nStackelberg games. Unfortunately, existing works exhibit quite negative\nresults, showing statistical hardness and computational hardness, assuming\nfollower's perfectly rational behaviors. Our work relaxes the perfect\nrationality agent assumption to the classic quantal response model, a more\nrealistic behavior model of bounded rationality. Interestingly, we show that\nthe smooth property brought by such bounded rationality model actually leads to\nprovably more efficient learning of the follower utility parameters in general\nStackelberg games. Systematic empirical experiments on synthesized games\nconfirm our theoretical results and further suggest its robustness beyond the\nstrict quantal response model.",

Third-party intervention plays an important role in\nmaking purchase decisions in this choice process. For instance, while\npurchasing products/services online, a buyer's choice or behavior is often\naffected by the overall reviewers' ratings, feedback, etc. Moreover, the\nreviewer is also a decision-maker. After purchase, the decision-maker would put\nforth their reviews for the product, online. Such reviews would affect the\npurchase decision of another potential buyer, who would read the reviews before\nconforming to his/her final purchase. The question that arises is \\textit{how\ntrustworthy are these review reports and ratings?} The trustworthiness of these\nreview reports and ratings is based on whether the reviewer is a rational or an\nirrational person. Indexing the reviewer's rationality could be a way to\nquantify a reviewer's rationality but it does not communicate the history of\nhis/her behavior. In this article, the researcher aims at formally deriving a\nrationality pattern function and thereby, the degree of rationality of the\ndecision-maker or the reviewer in the sequential choice problem in the\ne-commerce markets. Applying such a rationality pattern function could make it\neasier to quantify the rational behavior of an agent who participates in the\ndigital markets.

        "abstract": "Trading on decentralized exchanges has been one of the primary use cases for\npermissionless blockchains with daily trading volume exceeding billions of\nU.S.~dollars. In the status quo, users broadcast transactions and miners are\nresponsible for composing a block of transactions and picking an execution\nordering -- the order in which transactions execute in the exchange. Due to the\nlack of a regulatory framework, it is common to observe miners exploiting their\nprivileged position by front-running transactions and obtaining risk-fee\nprofits. In this work, we propose to modify the interaction between miners and\nusers and initiate the study of {\\em verifiable sequencing rules}. As in the\nstatus quo, miners can determine the content of a block; however, they commit\nto respecting a sequencing rule that constrains the execution ordering and is\nverifiable (there is a polynomial time algorithm that can verify if the\nexecution ordering satisfies such constraints). Thus in the event a miner\ndeviates from the sequencing rule, anyone can generate a proof of\nnon-compliance. We ask if there are sequencing rules that limit price\nmanipulation from miners in a two-token liquidity pool exchange. Our first\nresult is an impossibility theorem: for any sequencing rule, there is an\ninstance of user transactions where the miner can obtain non-zero risk-free\nprofits. In light of this impossibility result, our main result is a verifiable\nsequencing rule that provides execution price guarantees for users. In\nparticular, for any user transaction A, it ensures that either (1) the\nexecution price of A is at least as good as if A was the only transaction in\nthe block, or (2) the execution price of A is worse than this ``standalone''\nprice and the miner does not gain (or lose) when including A in the block.",

        "abstract": "Lately, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), i.e., uniquely discernible assets on a\nblockchain, have skyrocketed in popularity by addressing a broad audience.\nHowever, the typical NFT auctioning procedures are conducted in various, ad hoc\nways, while mostly ignoring the context that the blockchain provides. One of\nthe main targets of this work is to shed light on the vastly unexplored design\nspace of NFT Auction Mechanisms, especially in those characteristics that\nfundamentally differ from traditional and more contemporaneous forms of\nauctions. We focus on the case that bidders have a valuation for the auctioned\nNFT, i.e., what we term the single-item NFT auction case. In this setting, we\nformally define an NFT Auction Mechanism, give the properties that we would\nideally like a perfect mechanism to satisfy (broadly known as incentive\ncompatibility and collusion resistance) and prove that it is impossible to have\nsuch a perfect mechanism. Even though we cannot have an all-powerful protocol\nlike that, we move on to consider relaxed notions of those properties that we\nmay desire the protocol to satisfy, as a trade-off between implementability and\neconomic guarantees. Specifically, we define the notion of an\nequilibrium-truthful auction, where neither the seller nor the bidders can\nimprove their utility by acting non-truthfully, so long as the counter-party\nacts truthfully. We also define asymptotically second-price auctions, in which\nthe seller does not lose asymptotically any revenue in comparison to the\ntheoretically-optimal (static) second-price sealed-bid auction, in the case\nthat the bidders' valuations are drawn independently from some distribution. We\nshowcase why these two are very desirable properties for an auction mechanism\nto enjoy, and construct the first known NFT Auction Mechanism which provably\npossesses such formal guarantees.",

At each turn, Maxine stakes $a \\in [0,\\infty)$\nand Mina $b \\in [0,\\infty)$. The counter $X$ then moves adjacently, to the\nright with probability $\\tfrac{a}{a+b}$. If $X_i \\to -\\infty$ in this\ninfinte-turn game, Mina receives one unit, and Maxine zero; if $X_i \\to\n\\infty$, then these receipts are zero and $x$. Thus the net receipt to a given\nplayer is $-A+B$, where $A$ is the sum of her stakes, and $B$ is her terminal\nreceipt. The game was inspired by unbiased tug-of-war in~[PSSW] from 2009 but\nin fact closely resembles the original version of tug-of-war, introduced\n[HarrisVickers87] in the economics literature in 1987. We show that the game\nhas surprising features. For a natural class of strategies, Nash equilibria\nexist precisely when $x$ lies in $[\\lambda,\\lambda^{-1}]$, for a certain\n$\\lambda \\in (0,1)$.

We propose a two-stage formulation where one\nof the players has reserved resources that can be strategically pre-allocated\nacross the battlefields in the first stage.

The main contribution in this paper provides complete characterizations\nof equilibrium payoffs in the two-stage game, revealing the interplay between\nperformance and the amount of resources expended in each stage of the game. We\nfind that real-time resources are at least twice as effective as pre-allocated\nresources.

A seller sells one unit of a\ndivisible good, while the buyer relies on his private, rough valuation to\nchoose his first-stage consumption level. Consuming more leads to a more\nprecise valuation estimate, after which the buyer determines the second-stage\nconsumption level. The optimum is a menu of try-and-decide contracts,\nconsisting of a first-stage price-quantity pair and a second-stage per-unit\nprice for the remaining quantity. In equilibrium, a higher first-stage\nvaluation buyer pays more for higher first-stage consumption and enjoys a lower\nsecond-stage per-unit price. Methodologically, we deal with the difficulty that\ndue to the failure of single-crossing condition, monotonicity in allocation\nplus the envelope condition is insufficient for incentive compatibility.

This paper\nextends Myerson's results to a more general setting where the principal's\naction space can be infinite and subject to additional design constraints.\n  Our generalized principal-agent model unifies several important design\nproblems including contract design, information design, and Bayesian\nStackelberg games, and encompasses them as special cases. We first extend the\nrevelation principle to this general model, based on which a polynomial-time\nalgorithm is then derived for computing the optimal mechanism for the\nprincipal. This algorithm not only implies new efficient solutions\nsimultaneously for all the aforementioned special cases but also significantly\nsimplifies previously known algorithms designed for special cases. Inspired by\nthe recent interest in the algorithmic design of a single contract and menu of\ncontracts, we study such constrained design problems to our general\nprincipal-agent model. In contrast to the above unification, our results here\nillustrate the other facet of diversity among different principal-agent design\nproblems and demonstrate how their different structures can lead to different\ncomplexities: some are tractable whereas others are APX-hard. Finally, we\nreveal an interesting connection of our model to the problem of information\nacquisition for decision making and study its algorithmic properties in\ngeneral.",

Designing a\nlottery requires modeling the buyer decision-making process for uncertain\noutcomes. One of the most promising descriptive models of such decision-making\nis the cumulative prospect theory (CPT), which represents people's different\nattitudes towards gain and loss, and their overestimation of extreme events. In\nthis study, we design a lottery that maximizes the seller's profit when the\nbuyers follow CPT. The derived problem is nonconvex and constrained, and hence,\nit is challenging to directly characterize its optimal solution. We overcome\nthis difficulty by reformulating the problem as a three-level optimization\nproblem. The reformulation enables us to characterize the optimal solution.\nBased on this characterization, we propose an algorithm that computes the\noptimal lottery in linear time with respect to the number of lottery tickets.\nIn addition, we provide an efficient algorithm for a more general setting in\nwhich the ticket price is constrained.

To study this question from a\ntheoretical perspective, we introduce a duopoly market where platform actions\nare bandit algorithms and the two platforms compete for user participation. A\nsalient feature of this market is that the quality of recommendations depends\non both the bandit algorithm and the amount of data provided by interactions\nfrom users. This interdependency between the algorithm performance and the\nactions of users complicates the structure of market equilibria and their\nquality in terms of user utility. Our main finding is that competition in this\nmarket does not perfectly align market outcomes with user utility.\nInterestingly, market outcomes exhibit misalignment not only when the platforms\nhave separate data repositories, but also when the platforms have a shared data\nrepository. Nonetheless, the data sharing assumptions impact what mechanism\ndrives misalignment and also affect the specific form of misalignment (e.g. the\nquality of the best-case and worst-case market outcomes). More broadly, our\nwork illustrates that competition in digital marketplaces has subtle\nconsequences for user utility that merit further investigation.",

        "abstract": "Spot electricity markets are considered under a Game-Theoretic framework,\nwhere risk averse players submit orders to the market clearing mechanism to\nmaximise their own utility. Consistent with the current practice in Europe, the\nmarket clearing mechanism is modelled as a Social Welfare Maximisation problem,\nwith zonal pricing, and we consider inflexible demand, physical constraints of\nthe electricity grid, and capacity-constrained producers. A novel type of\nnon-parametric risk aversion based on a defined worst case scenario is\nintroduced, and this reduces the dimensionality of the strategy variables and\nensures boundedness of prices. By leveraging these properties we devise Jacobi\nand Gauss-Seidel iterative schemes for computation of approximate global Nash\nEquilibria, which are in contrast to derivative based local equilibria. Our\nmethodology is applied to the real world data of Central Western European (CWE)\nSpot Market during the 2019-2020 period, and offers a good representation of\nthe historical time series of prices. By also solving for the assumption of\ntruthful bidding, we devise a simple method based on hypothesis testing to\ninfer if and when producers are bidding strategically (instead of truthfully),\nand we find evidence suggesting that strategic bidding may be fairly pronounced\nin the CWE region.",

Motivated by this quandary, we search for a mixed strategy\nequilibrium in a stochastic game of investment in the common good. Our results\nshow that, despite asymmetry, a mixed strategy equilibrium exists if the model\ntakes into account the repeated investment opportunities. The mixed strategy\nequilibrium disappears only if the asymmetry is sufficiently high.

In this paper, we study min-max games\nwith dependent strategy sets, where the strategy of the first player constrains\nthe behavior of the second. Such games are best understood as sequential, i.e.,\nStackelberg, games, for which the relevant solution concept is Stackelberg\nequilibrium, a generalization of Nash. One of the most popular algorithms for\nsolving min-max games is gradient descent ascent (GDA). We present a\nstraightforward generalization of GDA to min-max Stackelberg games with\ndependent strategy sets, but show that it may not converge to a Stackelberg\nequilibrium. We then introduce two variants of GDA, which assume access to a\nsolution oracle for the optimal Karush Kuhn Tucker (KKT) multipliers of the\ngames' constraints. We show that such an oracle exists for a large class of\nconvex-concave min-max Stackelberg games, and provide proof that our GDA\nvariants with such an oracle converge in $O(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^2})$\niterations to an $\\varepsilon$-Stackelberg equilibrium, improving on the most\nefficient algorithms currently known which converge in\n$O(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^3})$ iterations. We then show that solving Fisher\nmarkets, a canonical example of a min-max Stackelberg game, using our novel\nalgorithm, corresponds to buyers and sellers using myopic best-response\ndynamics in a repeated market, allowing us to prove the convergence of these\ndynamics in $O(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^2})$ iterations in Fisher markets. We close\nby describing experiments on Fisher markets which suggest potential ways to\nextend our theoretical results, by demonstrating how different properties of\nthe objective function can affect the convergence and convergence rate of our\nalgorithms.",

To meet the expected growing charging demand, it is\nnecessary to scale up the current charging infrastructure and to mitigate\ncurrent reliability deficiencies, e.g., due to broken connectors or misreported\ncharging station availability status. However, even within a properly\ndimensioned charging infrastructure, a risk for local bottlenecks remains if\nseveral drivers cannot coordinate their charging station visit decisions. Here,\nnavigation service platforms can optimally balance charging demand over\navailable stations to reduce possible station visit conflicts and increase user\nsatisfaction. While such fleet-optimized charging station visit recommendations\nmay alleviate local bottlenecks, they can also harm the system if\nself-interested navigation service platforms seek to maximize their own\ncustomers' satisfaction. To study these dynamics, we model fleet-optimized\ncharging station allocation as a resource allocation game in which navigation\nplatforms constitute players and assign potentially free charging stations to\ndrivers. We show that no pure Nash equilibrium guarantee exists for this game,\nwhich motivates us to study VCG mechanisms both in offline and online settings,\nto coordinate players' strategies toward a better social outcome.

        "abstract": "The auction of a single indivisible item is one of the most celebrated\nproblems in mechanism design with transfers. Despite its simplicity, it\nprovides arguably the cleanest and most insightful results in the literature.\nWhen the information that the auction is running is available to every\nparticipant, Myerson [20] provided a seminal result to characterize the\nincentive-compatible auctions along with revenue optimality. However, such a\nresult does not hold in an auction on a network, where the information of the\nauction is spread via the agents, and they need incentives to forward the\ninformation. In recent times, a few auctions (e.g., [13, 18]) were designed\nthat appropriately incentivized the intermediate nodes on the network to\npromulgate the information to potentially more valuable bidders. In this paper,\nwe provide a Myerson-like characterization of incentive-compatible auctions on\na network and show that the currently known auctions fall within this class of\nrandomized auctions. We then consider a special class called the referral\nauctions that are inspired by the multi-level marketing mechanisms [1, 6, 7]\nand obtain the structure of a revenue optimal referral auction for i.i.d.\nbidders. Through experiments, we show that even for non-i.i.d. bidders there\nexist auctions following this characterization that can provide a higher\nrevenue than the currently known auctions on networks.",

        "abstract": "In many multi-agent settings, participants can form teams to achieve\ncollective outcomes that may far surpass their individual capabilities.\nMeasuring the relative contributions of agents and allocating them shares of\nthe reward that promote long-lasting cooperation are difficult tasks.\nCooperative game theory offers solution concepts identifying distribution\nschemes, such as the Shapley value, that fairly reflect the contribution of\nindividuals to the performance of the team or the Core, which reduces the\nincentive of agents to abandon their team. Applications of such methods include\nidentifying influential features and sharing the costs of joint ventures or\nteam formation. Unfortunately, using these solutions requires tackling a\ncomputational barrier as they are hard to compute, even in restricted settings.\nIn this work, we show how cooperative game-theoretic solutions can be distilled\ninto a learned model by training neural networks to propose fair and stable\npayoff allocations. We show that our approach creates models that can\ngeneralize to games far from the training distribution and can predict\nsolutions for more players than observed during training. An important\napplication of our framework is Explainable AI: our approach can be used to\nspeed-up Shapley value computations on many instances.",

Without regulations, agents optimize the size of their\nindividual investments into the commons by balancing incurring costs with the\nreturns received. The resulting Nash equilibrium involves a self-consistency\nloop between individual investment decisions and the state of the commons. As a\nconsequence, several non-trivial properties emerge. For $N$ investing actors we\nprove rigorously that typical payoffs do not scale as $1/N$, the expected\nresult for cooperating agents, but as $(1/N)^2$. Payoffs are hence reduced with\nregard to the functional dependence on $N$, a situation denoted catastrophic\npoverty. We show that catastrophic poverty results from a fine-tuned balance\nbetween returns and costs. Additionally, a finite number of oligarchs may be\npresent. Oligarchs are characterized by payoffs that are finite and not\ndecreasing when $N$ increases. Our results hold for generic classes of models,\nincluding convex and moderately concave cost functions. For strongly concave\ncost functions the Nash equilibrium undergoes a collective reorganization,\nbeing characterized instead by entry barriers and sudden death forced market\nexits.",

We demonstrate that an\nefficient and envy-free assignment may not exist even for the simple case of\npartition matroid constraints, where the items are categorized and each agent\ndemands one item from each category. We then identify special cases in which an\nefficient and envy-free assignment always exists.

Expansion\nconsistency can also be formulated in the setting of social choice. In voting\ntheory, it states that any candidate chosen from two fields of candidates must\nbe chosen from the combined field of candidates. An important special case of\nthe axiom is binary expansion consistency, which states that any candidate\nchosen from an initial field of candidates and chosen in a head-to-head match\nwith a new candidate must also be chosen when the new candidate is added to the\nfield, thereby ruling out spoiler effects. In this paper, we study the tension\nbetween this weakening of expansion consistency and weakenings of resoluteness,\nan axiom demanding the choice of a single candidate in any election. As is well\nknown, resoluteness is inconsistent with basic fairness conditions on social\nchoice, namely anonymity and neutrality. Here we prove that even significant\nweakenings of resoluteness, which are consistent with anonymity and neutrality,\nare inconsistent with binary expansion consistency. The proofs make use of SAT\nsolving, with the correctness of a SAT encoding formally verified in the Lean\nTheorem Prover, as well as a strategy for generalizing impossibility theorems\nobtained for special types of voting methods (namely majoritarian and pairwise\nvoting methods) to impossibility theorems for arbitrary voting methods. This\nproof strategy may be of independent interest for its potential applicability\nto other impossibility theorems in social choice.",

Due to this\nnonlinearity, the standard approach to finding the optimal persuasion mechanism\nusing revelation principle fails. To overcome this difficulty, we use the\nunderlying geometry of the problem to develop a convex optimization framework\nto find the optimal persuasion mechanism. We define the notion of full\npersuasion and use our framework to characterize conditions under which full\npersuasion can be achieved. We use our approach to study binary persuasion,\nwhere the receiver has two actions and the sender strictly prefers one of them\nat every state. Under a convexity assumption, we show that the binary\npersuasion problem reduces to a linear program, and establish a canonical set\nof signals where each signal either reveals the state or induces in the\nreceiver uncertainty between two states. Finally, we discuss the broader\napplicability of our methods to more general contexts, and illustrate our\nmethodology by studying information sharing of waiting times in service\nsystems.",

I identify necessary conditions for interim\nrealizability, and show that these conditions are sufficient for realizability\nwhen the interim allocation in question is scaled by 1/2. I then characterize a\nsubset of the realizable polytope which contains all such scaled allocations.\nThis polytope is generated by a majorization relationship between the scaled\ninterim allocations and allocations induced by a certain ``greedy algorithm''.\nI use these results to study mechanism design with equity concerns and model\nambiguity. I also relate optimal mechanisms to the commonly used deferred\nacceptance and serial dictatorship matching algorithms. For example, I provide\nconditions on the principal's objective such that by carefully choosing school\npriorities and running deferred acceptance, the principal can guarantee at\nleast half of the optimal (full information) payoff.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines whether one can learn to play an optimal action while\nonly knowing part of true specification of the environment. We choose the\noptimal pricing problem as our laboratory, where the monopolist is endowed with\nan underspecified model of the market demand, but can observe market outcomes.\nIn contrast to conventional learning models where the model specification is\ncomplete and exogenously fixed, the monopolist has to learn the specification\nand the parameters of the demand curve from the data. We formulate the learning\ndynamics as an algorithm that forecast the optimal price based on the data,\nfollowing the machine learning literature (Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David\n(2014)). Inspired by PAC learnability, we develop a new notion of learnability\nby requiring that the algorithm must produce an accurate forecast with a\nreasonable amount of data uniformly over the class of models consistent with\nthe part of the true specification. In addition, we assume that the monopolist\nhas a lexicographic preference over the payoff and the complexity cost of the\nalgorithm, seeking an algorithm with a minimum number of parameters subject to\nPAC-guaranteeing the optimal solution (Rubinstein (1986)). We show that for the\nset of demand curves with strictly decreasing uniformly Lipschitz continuous\nmarginal revenue curve, the optimal algorithm recursively estimates the slope\nand the intercept of the linear demand curve, even if the actual demand curve\nis not linear. The monopolist chooses a misspecified model to save\ncomputational cost, while learning the true optimal decision uniformly over the\nset of underspecified demand curves.",

Our thesis is that the economic perspective\nand investment decision-making are vital factors in determining the outcome of\nthe struggle. To build our economic framework, we borrow from the pioneering\nwork of Gordon and Loeb in which the Defender optimally trades-off investments\nfor lower likelihood of its system breach. Our two-sided model additionally has\nan Attacker, assumed to be rational and also guided by economic considerations\nin its decision-making, to which the Defender responds. Our model is a\nsimplified adaptation of a model proposed during the Cold War for weapons\ndeployment in the US. Our model may also be viewed as a Stackelberg game and,\nfrom an analytic perspective, as a Max-Min problem, the analysis of which is\nknown to have to contend with discontinuous behavior. The complexity of our\nsimple model is rooted in its inherent nonlinearity and, more consequentially,\nnon-convexity of the objective function in the optimization. The possibilities\nof the Attacker's actions add substantially to the risk to the Defender, and\nthe Defender's rational, risk-neutral optimal investments in general\nsubstantially exceed the optimal investments predicted by the one-sided\nGordon-Loeb model. We obtain a succinct set of three decision types that\ncategorize all of the Defender's optimal investment decisions. Also, the\nDefender's optimal decisions exhibit discontinuous behavior as the initial\nvulnerability of its system is varied. The analysis is supplemented by\nextensive numerical illustrations.

In practice, elections using IRV often\nrestrict the ballot length, the number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank\non their ballot. We theoretically and empirically analyze how ballot length can\ninfluence the outcome of an election, given fixed voter preferences. We show\nthat there exist preference profiles over $k$ candidates such that up to $k-1$\ndifferent candidates win at different ballot lengths. We derive exact lower\nbounds on the number of voters required for such profiles and provide a\nconstruction matching the lower bound for unrestricted voter preferences.\nAdditionally, we characterize which sequences of winners are possible over\nballot lengths and provide explicit profile constructions achieving any\nfeasible winner sequence. We also examine how classic preference restrictions\ninfluence our results--for instance, single-peakedness makes $k-1$ different\nwinners impossible but still allows at least $\\Omega(\\sqrt k)$. Finally, we\nanalyze a collection of 168 real-world elections, where we truncate rankings to\nsimulate shorter ballots.

A pillar\nof innovation in business practices is the adoption of novel pricing schemes,\nsuch as Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW). In this paper, we employed game theory and\nbehavioral economics to model consumers' behavior in response to a PWYW pricing\nstrategy where there is an information asymmetry between the consumer and\nsupplier. In an effort to minimize the information asymmetry, we incorporated\nthe supplier's cost and the consumer's reference prices as two parameters that\nmight influence the consumer's payment decision. Our model shows that\nconsumers' behavior varies depending on the available information. As a result,\nwhen an external reference point is provided, the consumer tends to pay higher\namounts to follow the social herd or respect her self-image. However, the\nexternal reference price can also decrease her demand when, in the interest of\nfairness, she forgoes the purchase because the amount she is willing to pay is\nless that what she recognizes to be an unrecoverable cost to the supplier.",

The players produce\noutputs for a set of activities, and the winning criteria of the contests are\nbased on these outputs. We consider two variations of the model: (i) players\nhave costs for producing outputs; (ii) players do not have costs but have\ngeneralized budget constraints. We observe that these games are exact potential\ngames and hence always have a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. The price of\nanarchy is $2$ for the budget model, but can be unbounded for the cost model.\nOur main results are for the computational complexity of these games. We prove\nthat for general versions of the model exactly or approximately computing a\nbest response is NP-hard. For natural restricted versions where best response\nis easy to compute, we show that finding a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is\nPLS-complete, and finding a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium is\n(PPAD$\\cap$PLS)-complete. On the other hand, an approximate pure-strategy Nash\nequilibrium can be found in pseudo-polynomial time.

The user who broadcasts the lowest-scoring\ncredential is the leader for round $r$, and their credential becomes the seed\n$Q_{r+1}$. Such protocols leave open the possibility of a selfish-mining style\nattack: a user who owns multiple accounts that each produce low-scoring\ncredentials in round $r$ can selectively choose which ones to broadcast in\norder to influence the seed for round $r+1$. Indeed, the user can pre-compute\ntheir credentials for round $r+1$ for each potential seed, and broadcast only\nthe credential (among those with a low enough score to be the leader) that\nproduces the most favorable seed.\n  We consider an adversary who wishes to maximize the expected fraction of\nrounds in which an account they own is the leader.

Further, random social choice rules\nsatisfying these properties have been shown to be convex combinations of\nrespective deterministic rules. We non-trivially add to this body of results by\nincluding fairness considerations in social choice. Our study directly\naddresses fairness for groups of agents. To study group-fairness, we consider\nan existing partition of the agents into logical groups, based on natural\nattributes such as gender, race, and location. To capture fairness within each\ngroup, we introduce the notion of group-wise anonymity. To capture fairness\nacross the groups, we propose a weak notion as well as a strong notion of\nfairness. The proposed fairness notions turn out to be natural generalizations\nof existing individual-fairness notions and moreover provide non-trivial\noutcomes for strict ordinal preferences, unlike the existing group-fairness\nnotions. We provide two separate characterizations of random social choice\nrules that satisfy group-fairness: (i) direct characterization (ii) extreme\npoint characterization (as convex combinations of fair deterministic social\nchoice rules). We also explore the special case where there are no groups and\nprovide sharper characterizations of rules that achieve individual-fairness.",

We formulate\nthe problem as a leader-followers problem, where a leader aims to implant a\ndesired profile of control strategies among selfish players. In this paper, we\nleverage frequency-domain techniques to develop a necessary and sufficient\ncondition on the existence of cost parameters for a given profile of\nstabilizing control strategies to be Nash under a given linear system. The\nnecessary and sufficient condition includes the circle criterion for each\nplayer and a rank condition related to the transfer function of each player.\nThe condition provides an analytical method to check the existence of such cost\nparameters, while previous studies need to solve a convex feasibility problem\nnumerically to answer the same question. We develop an identity in\nfrequency-domain representation to characterize the cost parameters, which we\nrefer to as the Kalman equation. The Kalman equation reduces redundancy in the\ntime-domain analysis that involves solving a convex feasibility problem. Using\nthe Kalman equation, we also show the leader can enforce the same Nash profile\nby applying penalties on the shared state instead of penalizing the player for\nother players' actions to avoid the impression of unfairness.",

This paper provides a theoretical\npanorama of a single advertiser's dynamic budget throttling process in repeated\nsecond-price auctions. We first establish a lower bound on the regret and an\nupper bound on the asymptotic competitive ratio for any throttling algorithm,\nrespectively, when the advertiser's values are stochastic and adversarial.\nRegarding the algorithmic side, we propose the OGD-CB algorithm, which\nguarantees a near-optimal expected regret with stochastic values. On the other\nhand, when values are adversarial, we prove that this algorithm also reaches\nthe upper bound on the asymptotic competitive ratio. We further compare\nthrottling with pacing, another widely adopted budget control method, in\nrepeated second-price auctions. In the stochastic case, we demonstrate that\npacing is generally superior to throttling for the advertiser, supporting the\nwell-known result that pacing is asymptotically optimal in this scenario.\nHowever, in the adversarial case, we give an exciting result indicating that\nthrottling is also an asymptotically optimal dynamic bidding strategy. Our\nresults bridge the gaps in theoretical research of throttling in repeated\nauctions and comprehensively reveal the ability of this popular\nbudget-smoothing strategy.",

However, under the expectation that other\nagents will share their data, rational agents may be tempted to engage in\ndetrimental behavior such as free-riding where they contribute no data but\nstill enjoy an improved model. In this work, we propose a framework to analyze\nthe behavior of such rational data generators. We first show how a naive scheme\nleads to catastrophic levels of free-riding where the benefits of data sharing\nare completely eroded. Then, using ideas from contract theory, we introduce\naccuracy shaping based mechanisms to maximize the amount of data generated by\neach agent.

The players have additive values for the goods. The prior distributions\non those values are common knowledge. We consider both the cases of independent\nvalues and values that are correlated across players (as occurs when there is a\ncommon-value component).\n  We describe the structure of optimal divisions in the divide-and-choose game\nand identify several cases where it is possible to efficiently compute\nequilibria. An approximation algorithm is presented for the case when the\ndistribution over the chooser's value for each good follows a normal\ndistribution, along with a randomized approximation algorithm for the case of\nuniform distributions over intervals.\n  A mixture of analytic results and computational simulations illuminates\nseveral striking differences between optimal strategies in the cases of known\nversus unknown preferences. Most notably, given unknown preferences, the\ndivider has a compelling \"diversification\" incentive in creating the chooser's\ntwo options. This incentive leads to multiple goods being divided at\nequilibrium, quite contrary to the divider's optimal strategy when preferences\nare known.\n  In many contexts, such as buy-and-sell provisions between partners, or in\njudging fairness, it is important to assess the relative expected utilities of\nthe divider and chooser. Those utilities, we show, depend on the players'\nlevels of knowledge about each other's values, the correlations between the\nplayers' values, and the number of goods being divided. Under fairly mild\nassumptions, we show that the chooser is strictly better off for a small number\nof goods, while the divider is strictly better off for a large number of goods.",

Certain utility responding\nto the contemporary coloring assignment will be received by each agent under\nsome particular mechanism, who, striving to maximize his own utility, is\nrestricted to local information thus self-organizing when choosing another\ncolor. Our focus is on maximizing some utilitarian-looking welfare objective\nfunction concerning the cumulative utilities across the network in a\ndecentralized fashion. Firstly, we investigate on a special class of the\nG-VCGs, namely Identical Preference VCGs (IP-VCGs) which recovers the\nrudimentary work by \\cite{chaudhuri2008network}. We reveal its convergence even\nunder a completely greedy policy and completely synchronous settings, with a\nstochastic bound on the converging rate provided. Secondly, regarding the\ngeneral G-VCGs, a greediness-preserved Metropolis-Hasting based policy is\nproposed for each agent to initiate with the limited information and its\noptimality under asynchronous settings is proved using theories from the\nregular perturbed Markov processes. The policy was also empirically witnessed\nto be robust under independently synchronous settings. Thirdly, in the spirit\nof ``robust coloring'', we include an expected loss term in our objective\nfunction to balance between the utilities and robustness. An optimal coloring\nfor this robust welfare optimization would be derived through a second-stage\nMH-policy driven algorithm.

In the specific context of misspecified Markov Decision\nProcesses, Esponda and Pouzo (2021) defined the notion of Berk-Nash equilibrium\nand established its existence in the setting of finite state and action spaces.\nHowever, many substantive applications (including two of the three motivating\nexamples presented by Esponda and Pouzo, as well as Gaussian and log-normal\ndistributions, and CARA, CRRA and mean-variance preferences) involve continuous\nstate or action spaces, and are thus not covered by the Esponda-Pouzo existence\ntheorem. We extend the existence of Berk-Nash equilibrium to compact action\nspaces and sigma-compact state spaces, with possibly unbounded payoff\nfunctions. A complication arises because the Berk-Nash equilibrium notion\ndepends critically on Radon-Nikodym derivatives, which are necessarily bounded\nin the finite case but typically unbounded in misspecified continuous models.\nThe proofs rely on nonstandard analysis and, relative to previous applications\nof nonstandard analysis in economic theory, draw on novel argumentation\ntraceable to work of the second author on nonstandard representations of Markov\nprocesses.",

Economists and mathematicians have\nindependently studied tug-of-war for many years, focussing respectively on\nresource-allocation forms of the game, in which players iteratively spend\nprecious budgets in an effort to influence the bias of the coins that determine\nthe turn victors; and on PDE arising in fine mesh limits of the constant-bias\ngame in a Euclidean setting.\n  In this article, we offer a mathematical treatment of a class of tug-of-war\ngames with allocated budgets: each player is initially given a fixed budget\nwhich she draws on throughout the game to offer a stake at the start of each\nturn, and her probability of winning the turn is the ratio of her stake and the\nsum of the two stakes. We consider the game played on a tree, with boundary\nbeing the set of leaves, and the payment function being the indicator of a\nsingle distinguished leaf. We find the game value and the essentially unique\nNash equilibrium of a leisurely version of the game, in which the move at any\ngiven turn is cancelled with constant probability after stakes have been\nplaced. We show that the ratio of the players' remaining budgets is maintained\nat its initial value $\\lambda$; game value is a biased infinity harmonic\nfunction; and the proportion of remaining budget that players stake at a given\nturn is given in terms of the spatial gradient and the $\\lambda$-derivative of\ngame value.

Our analysis for the former restriction\nleads to the discovery of a new class of tractable instances for the Set Union\nKnapsack problem, a classical problem in combinatorial optimization.",

        "abstract": "Islamic and capitalist economies have several differences, the most\nfundamental being that the Islamic economy is characterized by the prohibition\nof interest (riba) and speculation (gharar) and the enforcement of\nShariah-compliant profit-loss sharing (mudaraba, murabaha, salam, etc.) and\nwealth redistribution (waqf, sadaqah, and zakat). In this study, I apply new\neconophysics models of wealth exchange and redistribution to quantitatively\ncompare these characteristics to those of capitalism and evaluate wealth\ndistribution and disparity using a simulation. Specifically, regarding\nexchange, I propose a loan interest model representing finance capitalism and\nriba and a joint venture model representing shareholder capitalism and\nmudaraba; regarding redistribution, I create a transfer model representing\ninheritance tax and waqf. As exchanges are repeated from an initial uniform\ndistribution of wealth, wealth distribution approaches a power-law distribution\nmore quickly for the loan interest than the joint venture model; and the Gini\nindex, representing disparity, rapidly increases. The joint venture model's\nGini index increases more slowly, but eventually, the wealth distribution in\nboth models becomes a delta distribution, and the Gini index gradually\napproaches 1. Next, when both models are combined with the transfer model to\nredistribute wealth in every given period, the loan interest model has a larger\nGini index than the joint venture model, but both converge to a Gini index of\nless than 1. These results quantitatively reveal that in the Islamic economy,\ndisparity is restrained by prohibiting riba and promoting reciprocal exchange\nin mudaraba and redistribution through waqf. Comparing Islamic and capitalist\neconomies provides insights into the benefits of economically embracing the\nethical practice of mutual aid and suggests guidelines for an alternative to\ncapitalism.",

We show that the\nwelfare effect of joint intervention is shaped by the principal eigenvalue,\nwhile the distributional effect is captured by the dispersion of the\ncorresponding eigenvalues, i.e., the eigen-centralities. Comparing joint\nintervention in our setting with single intervention solely on the standalone\nmarginal utilities, as studied by Galeotti et al.

Classical stopping theory assumes that\nsellers have full knowledge of the value distributions, and leverage this\nknowledge to determine stopping rules that maximize expected welfare. In\npractice, however, stopping rules must often be determined under partial\ninformation, based on scarce data or expert predictions. Consider a seller that\nhas one item for sale and receives successive offers drawn from some value\ndistributions. The decision on whether or not to accept an offer is\nirrevocable, and the value distributions are only partially known. We therefore\nlet the seller adopt a robust maximin strategy, assuming that value\ndistributions are chosen adversarially by nature to minimize the value of the\naccepted offer. We provide a general maximin solution to this stopping problem\nthat identifies the optimal (threshold-based) stopping rule for the seller for\nall possible statistical information structures. We then perform a detailed\nanalysis for various ambiguity sets relying on knowledge about the common mean,\ndispersion (variance or mean absolute deviation) and support of the\ndistributions. We show for these information structures that the seller's\nstopping rule consists of decreasing thresholds converging to the common mean,\nand that nature's adversarial response, in the long run, is to always create an\nall-or-nothing scenario.

        "abstract": "A voting rule decides on a probability distribution over a set of m\nalternatives, based on rankings of those alternatives provided by agents. We\nassume that agents have cardinal utility functions over the alternatives, but\nvoting rules have access to only the rankings induced by these utilities. We\nevaluate how well voting rules do on measures of social welfare and of\nproportional fairness, computed based on the hidden utility functions.\n  In particular, we study the distortion of voting rules, which is a worst-case\nmeasure. It is an approximation ratio comparing the utilitarian social welfare\nof the optimum outcome to the social welfare produced by the outcome selected\nby the voting rule, in the worst case over possible input profiles and utility\nfunctions that are consistent with the input. The previous literature has\nstudied distortion with unit-sum utility functions (which are normalized to sum\nto 1), and left a small asymptotic gap in the best possible distortion. Using\ntools from the theory of fair multi-winner elections, we propose the first\nvoting rule which achieves the optimal distortion $\\Theta(\\sqrt{m})$ for\nunit-sum utilities. Our voting rule also achieves optimum $\\Theta(\\sqrt{m})$\ndistortion for a larger class of utilities, including unit-range and approval\n(0/1) utilities.\n  We then take a worst-case approach to a quantitative measure of the fairness\nof a voting rule, called proportional fairness. Informally, it measures whether\nthe influence of cohesive groups of agents on the voting outcome is\nproportional to the group size. We show that there is a voting rule which,\nwithout knowledge of the utilities, can achieve a $\\Theta(\\log\nm)$-approximation to proportional fairness, and thus also to Nash welfare and\nto the core, making it interesting for applications in participatory budgeting.\nFor all three approximations, we show that $\\Theta(\\log m)$ is the best\npossible.",

Since this phenomenon can lead to patterns of interactions that\nsegregate people along different demographic dimensions, it can also lead to\ninequalities in access to information, resources, and opportunities. As we\nconsider potential interventions that might alleviate the effects of\nsegregation, we face the challenge that homophily constitutes a pervasive and\norganic force that is difficult to push back against. Designing effective\ninterventions can therefore benefit from identifying counterbalancing social\nprocesses that might be harnessed to work in opposition to segregation.\n  In this work, we show that triadic closure -- another common phenomenon that\nposits that individuals with a mutual connection are more likely to be\nconnected to one another -- can be one such process. In doing so, we challenge\na long-held belief that triadic closure and homophily work in tandem. By\nanalyzing several fundamental network models using popular integration\nmeasures, we demonstrate the desegregating potential of triadic closure. We\nfurther empirically investigate this effect on real-world dynamic networks,\nsurfacing observations that mirror our theoretical findings. We leverage these\ninsights to discuss simple interventions that can help reduce segregation in\nsettings that exhibit an interplay between triadic closure and homophily. We\nconclude with a discussion on qualitative implications for the design of\ninterventions in settings where individuals arrive in an online fashion, and\nthe designer can influence the initial set of connections.",

        "abstract": "Demand response involves system operators using incentives to modulate\nelectricity consumption during peak hours or when faced with an incidental\nsupply shortage. However, system operators typically have imperfect information\nabout their customers' baselines, that is, their consumption had the incentive\nbeen absent. The standard approach to estimate the reduction in a customer's\nelectricity consumption then is to estimate their counterfactual baseline.\nHowever, this approach is not robust to estimation errors or strategic\nexploitation by the customers and can potentially lead to overpayments to\ncustomers who do not reduce their consumption and underpayments to those who\ndo. Moreover, optimal power consumption reductions of the customers depend on\nthe costs that they incur for curtailing consumption, which in general are\nprivate knowledge of the customers, and which they could strategically\nmisreport in an effort to improve their own utilities even if it deteriorates\nthe overall system cost. The two-stage mechanism proposed in this paper\ncircumvents the aforementioned issues. In the day-ahead market, the\nparticipating loads are required to submit only a probabilistic description of\ntheir next-day consumption and costs to the system operator for day-ahead\nplanning. It is only in real-time, if and when called upon for demand response,\nthat the loads are required to report their baselines and costs. They receive\ncredits for reductions below their reported baselines. The mechanism for\ncalculating the credits guarantees incentive compatibility of truthful\nreporting of the probability distribution in the day-ahead market and truthful\nreporting of the baseline and cost in real-time. The mechanism can be viewed as\nan extension of the celebrated Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism augmented with a\ncarefully crafted second-stage penalty for deviations from the day-ahead bids.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of aggregating individual preferences over\nalternatives into a social ranking. A key feature of the problems that we\nconsider - and the one that allows us to obtain positive results, in contrast\nto negative results such as Arrow's Impossibililty Theorem - is that the\nalternatives to be ranked are outcomes of a competitive process. Examples\ninclude rankings of colleges or academic journals. The foundation of our\nranking method is that alternatives that agents rank higher than the one they\nreceive (and thus have been rejected by) should also be ranked higher in the\naggregate ranking. We introduce axioms to formalize this idea, and call any\nranking that satisfies our axioms a desirable ranking. We show that as the\nmarket grows large, any desirable ranking coincides with the true underlying\nranking of colleges by quality. Last, we provide an algorithm for constructing\ndesirable rankings, and show that the outcome of this algorithm is the unique\nranking of the colleges that satisfy our axioms.",

The\nEconomics models do not explain the ``probability matching\" phenomena that are\nobserved in many experimental studies. To address these observations, Bayesian\nmodels that do not formally fit into the economic utility maximization\nframework were introduced. In these models individuals sample from their\nposteriors in communication. In this work we study the asymptotic behavior of\nsuch models on connected networks with repeated communication. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, despite the fact that individual agents are not utility\nmaximizers in the classical sense, we establish that the individuals ultimately\nagree and furthermore show that the limiting posterior is Bayes optimal.\n  We explore the interpretation of our results in terms of Large Language\nModels (LLMs). In the positive direction our results can be interpreted as\nstating that interaction between different LLMs can lead to optimal learning.\nHowever, we provide an example showing how misspecification may lead LLM agents\nto be overconfident in their estimates.",

Information flow also helps in defining an intuitive\nnotion of immediacy for gradual mechanisms which is equivalent to their game\nstructures being minimal. Given that the class of gradual mechanisms serves as\na revelation principle for dynamic implementation (Li, 2017; Akbarpour and Li,\n2020; Mackenzie, 2020; Chew and Wang, 2022), the class of immediate gradual\nmechanisms provides a refined revelation principle.",

To achieve this, we formalize a general framework distinguishing\nbetween three degrees of quarrelling (weak, strong, cataclysmic), symmetric vs.\nasymmetrical quarrels, and reciprocal vs. non-reciprocal quarrels, and which\nthereby yields twelve conceptions of quarrelling, which encompasses the two\nconceptions proposed by Felsenthal and Machover and by Laruelle and Valenciano,\nrespectively. We argue that the two existing formulations of the quarrel\npostulate based on these conceptions are unreasonable.

Every agent $i$ has a\nvaluation $v_i$ from some given class of valuation functions. A share $s$ is a\nfunction that maps a pair $(v_i,n)$ to a value, with the interpretation that if\nan allocation of $M$ to $n$ agents fails to give agent $i$ a bundle of value at\nleast equal to $s(v_i,n)$, this serves as evidence that the allocation is not\nfair towards $i$. For such an interpretation to make sense, we would like the\nshare to be feasible, meaning that for any valuations in the class, there is an\nallocation that gives every agent at least her share. The maximin share was a\nnatural candidate for a feasible share for additive valuations. However,\nKurokawa, Procaccia and Wang [2018] show that it is not feasible.\n  We initiate a systematic study of the family of feasible shares. We say that\na share is \\emph{self maximizing} if truth-telling maximizes the implied\nguarantee. We show that every feasible share is dominated by some\nself-maximizing and feasible share. We seek to identify those self-maximizing\nfeasible shares that are polynomial time computable, and offer the highest\nshare values. We show that a SM-dominating feasible share -- one that dominates\nevery self-maximizing (SM) feasible share -- does not exist for additive\nvaluations (and beyond). Consequently, we relax the domination property to that\nof domination up to a multiplicative factor of $\\rho$ (called\n$\\rho$-dominating). For additive valuations we present shares that are\nfeasible, self-maximizing and polynomial-time computable. For $n$ agents we\npresent such a share that is $\\frac{2n}{3n-1}$-dominating. For two agents we\npresent such a share that is $(1 - \\epsilon)$-dominating.

In that respect, I first\ncontribute by identifying a class of models of discriminatory institutions,\nmade up of theories of discriminatory social norms and discriminatory\ninstitutional design.

This emergent preference can have wide-ranging\nconsequences, ranging from concerns about fairness to homogenization, and holds\ntransiently even when the riskier action has a strictly higher expected payoff.\nWe discuss two methods to correct this bias.

In this paper, we envision a platform\nfor improving predictions via implicit pooling of private information in return\nfor possible remuneration.

This market delivers an aggregated forecast to the buyer\n(pre-event) and allocates a payoff to the sellers (post-event) for their\ncontribution. We propose a payoff mechanism and prove that it satisfies several\ndesirable economic properties, including those specific to electronic\nplatforms. Furthermore, we discuss the properties of the forecast aggregation\noperator and scoring rules to emphasize their effect on the sellers' payoff.\nFinally, we provide numerical examples to illustrate the structure and\nproperties of the proposed market platform.",

More specifically, we mathematically\nprove the conditions wherein the deviation of the resultant chance of obtaining\neach choice from the individual preference profile, which we call the loss,\nbecomes zero, meaning that all players' satisfaction is perfectly appreciated\nwhile avoiding decision conflicts. Furthermore, even in situations where\nzero-loss conflict-free joint decision-making is unachievable, we show how to\nderive joint decision-making that accomplishes the theoretical minimum loss\nwhile ensuring conflict-free choices. Numerical demonstrations are also shown\nwith several benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Epidemics of infectious diseases posing a serious risk to human health have\noccurred throughout history. During recent epidemics there has been much debate\nabout policy, including how and when to impose restrictions on behaviour.\nPolicymakers must balance a complex spectrum of objectives, suggesting a need\nfor quantitative tools. Whether health services might be `overwhelmed' has\nemerged as a key consideration. Here we show how costly interventions, such as\ntaxes or subsidies on behaviour, can be used to exactly align individuals'\ndecision making with government preferences even when these are not aligned. In\norder to achieve this, we develop a nested optimisation algorithm of both the\ngovernment intervention strategy and the resulting equilibrium behaviour of\nindividuals. We focus on a situation in which the capacity of the healthcare\nsystem to treat patients is limited and identify conditions under which the\ndisease dynamics respect the capacity limit. We find an extremely sharp drop in\npeak infections at a critical maximum infection cost in the government's\nobjective function. This is in marked contrast to the gradual reduction of\ninfections if individuals make decisions without government intervention. We\nfind optimal interventions vary less strongly in time when interventions are\ncostly to the government and that the critical cost of the policy switch\ndepends on how costly interventions are.",

However, the problem of computing equilibrium prices in Fisher\nmarkets typically relies on complete knowledge of users' budgets and utility\nfunctions and requires transactions to happen in a static market where all\nusers are present simultaneously. Motivated by these practical considerations,\nwe study an online variant of Fisher markets, wherein users with privately\nknown utility and budget parameters, drawn i.i.d. from a distribution, arrive\nsequentially. In this setting, we first study the limitations of static pricing\nalgorithms, which set uniform prices for all users, along two performance\nmetrics: (i) regret, i.e., the optimality gap in the objective of the\nEisenberg-Gale program between an online algorithm and an oracle with complete\ninformation, and (ii) capacity violations, i.e., the over-consumption of goods\nrelative to their capacities. Given the limitations of static pricing, we\ndesign adaptive posted-pricing algorithms, one with knowledge of the\ndistribution of users' budget and utility parameters and another that adjusts\nprices solely based on past observations of user consumption, i.e., revealed\npreference feedback, with improved performance guarantees. Finally, we present\nnumerical experiments to compare our revealed preference algorithm's\nperformance to several benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "In the classical Bayesian persuasion model an informed player and an\nuninformed one engage in a static interaction. The informed player, the sender,\nknows the state of nature, while the uninformed one, the receiver, does not.\nThe informed player partially shares his private information with the receiver\nand the latter then, based on her belief about the state, takes an action. This\naction, together with the state of nature, determines the utility of both\nplayers. This paper analyzes a dynamic Bayesian persuasion model where the\nstate of nature evolves according to a Markovian law. Here, the sender always\nknows the realized state, while the receiver randomly gets to know it. We\ndiscuss the value of the sender when he becomes more and more patient and its\nrelation to the revelation rate, namely the probability at which the true state\nis revealed to the receiver at any stage.",

In\nparticular, the update of the incentive mechanism is based on each player's\nexternality, which is evaluated as the difference between the player's marginal\ncost and the society's marginal cost in each time step. We show that any fixed\npoint of our learning dynamics corresponds to the optimal incentive mechanism\nsuch that the corresponding Nash equilibrium also achieves social optimality.\nWe also provide sufficient conditions for the learning dynamics to converge to\na fixed point so that the adaptive incentive mechanism eventually induces a\nsocially optimal outcome.

        "abstract": "We propose a consumption-investment decision model where past consumption\npeak $h$ plays a crucial role. There are two important consumption levels: the\nlowest constrained level and a reference level, at which the risk aversion in\nterms of consumption rate is changed. We solve this stochastic control problem\nand derive the value function, optimal consumption plan, and optimal investment\nstrategy in semi-explicit forms. We find five important thresholds of wealth,\nall as functions of $h$, and most of them are nonlinear functions. As can be\nseen from numerical results and theoretical analysis, this intuitive and simple\nmodel has significant economic implications, and there are at least three\nimportant predictions: the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth is\ngenerally decreasing but can be increasing for intermediate wealth levels, and\nit jumps inversely proportional to the risk aversion at the reference point;\nthe implied relative risk aversion is roughly a smile in wealth; the welfare of\nthe poor is more vulnerable to wealth shocks than the wealthy. Moreover,\nlocally changing the risk aversion influences the optimal strategies globally,\nrevealing some risk allocation behaviors.",

We\nrelate performative power to the economic study of competition in digital\neconomies. Traditional economic concepts struggle with identifying\nanti-competitive patterns in digital platforms not least due to the complexity\nof market definition. In contrast, performative power is a causal notion that\nis identifiable with minimal knowledge of the market, its internals,\nparticipants, products, or prices.\n  Low performative power implies that a firm can do no better than to optimize\ntheir objective on current data. In contrast, firms of high performative power\nstand to benefit from steering the population towards more profitable behavior.\nWe confirm in a simple theoretical model that monopolies maximize performative\npower. A firm's ability to personalize increases performative power, while\ncompetition and outside options decrease performative power. On the empirical\nside, we propose an observational causal design to identify performative power\nfrom discontinuities in how digital platforms display content. This allows to\nrepurpose causal effects from various studies about digital platforms as lower\nbounds on performative power. Finally, we speculate about the role that\nperformative power might play in competition policy and antitrust enforcement\nin digital marketplaces.",

        "abstract": "In today's online advertising markets, it is common for advertisers to set\nlong-term budgets. Correspondingly, advertising platforms adopt budget control\nmethods to ensure that advertisers' payments lie within their budgets. Most\nbudget control methods rely on the value distributions of advertisers. However,\ndue to the complex advertising landscape and potential privacy concerns, the\nplatform hardly learns advertisers' true priors. Thus, it is crucial to\nunderstand how budget control auction mechanisms perform under unassured\npriors.\n  This work answers this problem from multiple aspects. We consider the\nunassured prior game among the seller and all buyers induced by different\nmechanisms in the stochastic model. We restrict the parameterized mechanisms to\nsatisfy the budget-extracting condition, which maximizes the seller's revenue\nby extracting buyers' budgets as effectively as possible. Our main result shows\nthat the Bayesian revenue-optimal mechanism and the budget-extracting\nbid-discount first-price mechanism yield the same set of Nash equilibrium\noutcomes in the unassured prior game. This implies that simple mechanisms can\nbe as robust as the optimal mechanism under unassured priors in the\nbudget-constrained setting. In the symmetric case, we further show that all\nthese five (budget-extracting) mechanisms share the same set of possible\noutcomes. We further dig into the structural properties of these mechanisms. We\ncharacterize sufficient and necessary conditions on the budget-extracting\nparameter tuple for bid-discount/pacing first-price auctions. Meanwhile, when\nbuyers do not take strategic behaviors, we exploit the dominance relationships\nof these mechanisms by revealing their intrinsic structures.",

Second, the policymaker is\nuncertain about the cost and adopts a robust disclosure rule to maximize the\nworst-case welfare. Depending on the elasticity of marginal cost, an optimal\nrule is qualitatively the same as that in the case of either a linear\ninformation cost or exogenous private information.

We apply this theory, and in particular the concepts of\nchain recurrence, attractors, and Conley index, to prove a general\nimpossibility result: there exist games for which any dynamics is bound to have\nstarting points that do not end up at a Nash equilibrium. We also prove a\nstronger result for $\\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria: there are games\nsuch that no game dynamics can converge (in an appropriate sense) to\n$\\epsilon$-Nash equilibria, and in fact the set of such games has positive\nmeasure. Further numerical results demonstrate that this holds for any\n$\\epsilon$ between zero and $0.09$.

In this paper, we investigate the\nbehavior of no-regret learning in min-max games with dependent strategy sets,\nwhere the strategy of the first player constrains the behavior of the second.\nSuch games are best understood as sequential, i.e., min-max Stackelberg, games.\nWe consider two settings, one in which only the first player chooses their\nactions using a no-regret algorithm while the second player best responds, and\none in which both players use no-regret algorithms. For the former case, we\nshow that no-regret dynamics converge to a Stackelberg equilibrium. For the\nlatter case, we introduce a new type of regret, which we call Lagrangian\nregret, and show that if both players minimize their Lagrangian regrets, then\nplay converges to a Stackelberg equilibrium. We then observe that online mirror\ndescent (OMD) dynamics in these two settings correspond respectively to a known\nnested (i.e., sequential) gradient descent-ascent (GDA) algorithm and a new\nsimultaneous GDA-like algorithm, thereby establishing convergence of these\nalgorithms to Stackelberg equilibrium. Finally, we analyze the robustness of\nOMD dynamics to perturbations by investigating online min-max Stackelberg\ngames. We prove that OMD dynamics are robust for a large class of online\nmin-max games with independent strategy sets.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel methodology that solves this long-standing\nidentification problem in a simple way, using a variant of the strategy method.\nOur method relies on the concept of a suitable proxy. The crucial property is\nthat the agent does not have any stakes in the proxy conditional on the\nrealization of the original state space. Then, instead of trying to identify\ndirectly the agent's beliefs about the state space, we elicit her conditional\nbeliefs about the proxy given each state realization. The latter can be easily\ndone with existing elicitation tools and without worrying about the\nidentification problem. It turns out that this is enough to uniquely identify\nthe agent's beliefs. We present different classes of proxies that one can\nreasonably use, and we show that it is almost always possible to find one which\nis easy to implement. Such flexibility makes our method, not only\ntheoretically-sound, but also empirically appealing. We also show how our new\nmethod allows us to provide a novel well-founded definition of a utility\nfunction over states. Last but not least, it also allows us to cleanly identify\nmotivated beliefs, freed from confounding distortions caused by the\nidentification problem.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of mechanism design for two-stage repeated stochastic\ngames -- a novel setting using which many emerging problems in next-generation\nelectricity markets can be readily modeled. Repeated playing affords the\nplayers a large class of strategies that adapt a player's actions to all past\nobservations and inferences obtained therefrom. In other settings such as\niterative auctions or dynamic games where a large strategy space of this sort\nmanifests, it typically has an important implication for mechanism design: It\nmay be impossible to obtain truth-telling as a dominant strategy equilibrium.\nConsequently, in such scenarios, it is common to settle for mechanisms that\nrender truth-telling only a Nash equilibrium, or variants thereof, even though\nNash equilibria are known to be poor models of real-world behavior. This is\nowing to each player having to make overly specific assumptions about the\nbehaviors of the other players to employ their Nash equilibrium strategy, which\nthey may not make. In general, the lesser the burden of speculation in an\nequilibrium, the more plausible it is that it models real-world behavior.\nGuided by this maxim, we introduce a new notion of equilibrium called Dominant\nStrategy Non-Bankrupting Equilibrium (DNBE) which requires the players to make\nvery little assumptions about the behavior of the other players to employ their\nequilibrium strategy. Consequently, a mechanism that renders truth-telling a\nDNBE as opposed to only a Nash equilibrium could be quite effective in molding\nreal-world behavior along truthful lines. We present a mechanism for two-stage\nrepeated stochastic games that renders truth-telling a Dominant Strategy\nNon-Bankrupting Equilibrium. The mechanism also guarantees individual\nrationality and maximizes social welfare. Finally, we describe an application\nof the mechanism to design demand response markets.",

We initiate the study of class fairness in this setting, where\nagents are partitioned into a set of classes and the matching is required to be\nfair with respect to the classes. We adopt popular fairness notions from the\nfair division literature such as envy-freeness (up to one item),\nproportionality, and maximin share fairness to our setting.

For matching divisible\nitems, we design a water-filling-based algorithm, EQUAL-FILLING, that achieves\n(1-1/e)-approximation of class envy-freeness and class proportionality; we\nprove (1-1/e) to be tight for class proportionality and establish a 3/4 upper\nbound on class envy-freeness. Finally, we build upon EQUAL-FILLING to design a\nrandomized algorithm for matching indivisible items, EQAUL-FILLING-OCS, which\nachieves 0.593-approximation of class proportionality. The algorithm and its\nanalysis crucially leverage the recently introduced technique of online\ncorrelated selection (OCS) [Fahrbach et al., 2020].",

This policy has been\ninstrumental in increasing the number of disadvantaged students attending these\nschools. However, assuming that students care more about the school they are\nassigned to rather than the type of seat they occupy (\\emph{school-over-seat\nhypothesis}), our empirical analysis using data from 12 recent academic years\nshows that DISC creates about 950 in-group blocking pairs each year amongst\ndisadvantaged students, impacting about 650 disadvantaged students every year.\nMoreover, we find that this program does not respect improvements, thus\nunintentionally creating an incentive to under-perform. These experimental\nresults are confirmed by our theoretical analysis.\n  In order to alleviate the concerns caused by DISC, we explore two alternative\npolicies: the minority reserve (MR) and the joint-seat allocation (JSA)\nmechanisms. As our main theoretical contribution, we introduce a feature of\nmarkets, that we term high competitiveness, and we show that under this\ncondition, JSA dominates MR for all disadvantaged students. We give sufficient\nconditions under which high competitiveness is verified. Data from NYC DOE\nsatisfies the high competitiveness condition, and for this dataset our\nempirical results corroborate our theoretical predictions, showing the\nsuperiority of JSA. Given that JSA can be implemented by a simple modification\nof the classical deferred acceptance algorithm with responsive preference\nlists, we believe that, when the school-over-seat hypothesis holds, the\ndiscovery program can be changed for the better by implementing the JSA\nmechanism, leading in particular to aligned incentives for the top-performing\ndisadvantaged students.",

In this paper, we introduce an opinion dynamics\nmodel where agents are connected in a social network, and update their opinions\nbased on their neighbors' opinions and on the content shown to them by the\nplatform. We focus on a stochastic block model with two blocks, where the\ninitial opinions of the individuals in different blocks are different. We prove\nthat for large and dense enough networks the trajectory of opinion dynamics in\nsuch networks can be approximated well by a simple two-agent system. The latter\nadmits tractable analytical analysis, which we leverage to provide interesting\ninsights into the platform's impact on the social learning outcome in our\noriginal two-block model. Specifically, by using our approximation result, we\nshow that agents' opinions approximately converge to some limiting opinion,\nwhich is either: consensus, where all agents agree, or persistent disagreement,\nwhere agents' opinions differ. We find that when the platform is weak and there\nis a high number of connections between agents with different initial opinions,\na consensus equilibrium is likely. In this case, even if a persistent\ndisagreement equilibrium arises, the polarization in this equilibrium, i.e.,\nthe degree of disagreement, is low. When the platform is strong, a persistent\ndisagreement equilibrium is likely and the equilibrium polarization is high. A\nmoderate platform typically leads to a persistent disagreement equilibrium with\nmoderate polarization. We analyze the effect of initial polarization on\nconsensus and explore numerically various extensions including a three block\nstochastic model and a correlation between initial opinions and agents'\nconnection probabilities.",

This paper proposes a novel model of\nsequential information design, namely the Markov persuasion processes (MPPs),\nwhere a sender, with informational advantage, seeks to persuade a stream of\nmyopic receivers to take actions that maximizes the sender's cumulative\nutilities in a finite horizon Markovian environment with varying prior and\nutility functions. Planning in MPPs thus faces the unique challenge in finding\na signaling policy that is simultaneously persuasive to the myopic receivers\nand inducing the optimal long-term cumulative utilities of the sender.\nNevertheless, in the population level where the model is known, it turns out\nthat we can efficiently determine the optimal (resp. $\\epsilon$-optimal) policy\nwith finite (resp. infinite) states and outcomes, through a modified\nformulation of the Bellman equation.\n  Our main technical contribution is to study the MPP under the online\nreinforcement learning (RL) setting, where the goal is to learn the optimal\nsignaling policy by interacting with with the underlying MPP, without the\nknowledge of the sender's utility functions, prior distributions, and the\nMarkov transition kernels. We design a provably efficient no-regret learning\nalgorithm, the Optimism-Pessimism Principle for Persuasion Process (OP4), which\nfeatures a novel combination of both optimism and pessimism principles. Our\nalgorithm enjoys sample efficiency by achieving a sublinear $\\sqrt{T}$-regret\nupper bound. Furthermore, both our algorithm and theory can be applied to MPPs\nwith large space of outcomes and states via function approximation, and we\nshowcase such a success under the linear setting.",

We show it is without loss to focus on a class of\nmechanisms that compensate the buyer for his learning costs. Using these\nmechanisms, we prove that when marginal costs of quality are strictly\nincreasing, quality always lies strictly below the efficient level at all types\nstrictly below the highest possible type under the prior. When learning costs\nare sufficiently steep, it follows the monopolist optimum distorts quality\ndownward even \"at the top\" of the buyer's chosen signal structure. Moreover,\nwhen marginal costs of quality are constant, interior buyer types obtain\ninterior qualities. These results stand in contrast to the exogenous\ninformation case, which features \"no distortion at the top\" when marginal\nproduction costs are increasing, and serving the maximal quality to all types\nabove some threshold when marginal product costs are constant. We also show\nthat when learning costs are steep, the monopolist finds it optimal to offer a\nsimple menu that contains at most two purchasing options. Under appropriate\ncurvature conditions, offering a single purchasing option is optimal.",

Consequently, there is a\nlarge body of literature on characterizing the likelihood for an election to be\ninfluenced when the votes follow certain distributions, especially the\nlikelihood of being manipulable by a single voter under the i.i.d. uniform\ndistribution, known as the Impartial Culture (IC).\n  In this paper, we extend previous studies in three aspects: (1) we propose a\nmore general semi-random model, where a distribution adversary chooses a\nworst-case distribution and then a contamination adversary modifies up to\n$\\psi$ portion of the data, (2) we consider many coalitional influence\nproblems, including coalitional manipulation, margin of victory, and various\nvote controls and bribery, and (3) we consider arbitrary and variable coalition\nsize $B$. Our main theorem provides asymptotically tight bounds on the\nsemi-random likelihood of the existence of a size-$B$ coalition that can\nsuccessfully influence the election under a wide range of voting rules.\nApplications of the main theorem and its proof techniques resolve long-standing\nopen questions about the likelihood of coalitional manipulability under IC, by\nshowing that the likelihood is $\\Theta\\left(\\min\\left\\{\\frac{B}{\\sqrt n},\n1\\right\\}\\right)$ for many commonly-studied voting rules.\n  The main technical contribution is a characterization of the semi-random\nlikelihood for a Poisson multinomial variable (PMV) to be unstable, which we\nbelieve to be a general and useful technique with independent interest.",

We also show that for a given matching checking\nPareto-optimality and the strong core properties are co-NP-complete problems\nfor the many-to-many problem, and deciding the existence of a complete\nPareto-optimal matching is also NP-hard for the fixtures problem. On the\npositive side, we give efficient algorithms for finding a near feasible strong\ncore solution, where the capacities are only violated by at most one unit for\neach agent, and also for finding a half-matching in the strong core of\nfractional matchings. These polynomial time algorithms are based on the Top\nTrading Cycle algorithm. Finally, we also show that finding a maximum size\nmatching that is Pareto-optimal can be done efficiently for many-to-many\nproblems, which is in contrast with the hardness result for the fixtures\nproblem.",

In such markets, we establish the efficiency of equilibrium\narrangements, specified by an assignment and transfers between agents on the\ntwo sides of the market, and study the conditions on the distributional\nconstraints and agent preferences under which equilibria exist and can be\ncomputed efficiently. To this end, we first consider the setting when the\nnumber of institutions (e.g., firms in a labor market) is one and show that\nequilibrium arrangements exist irrespective of the nature of the constraint\nstructure or the agents' preferences. However, equilibrium arrangements may not\nexist in markets with multiple institutions even when agents on each side have\nlinear (or additively separable) preferences over agents on the other side.\nThus, for markets with linear preferences, we study sufficient conditions on\nthe constraint structure that guarantee the existence of equilibria using\nlinear programming duality. Our linear programming approach not only\ngeneralizes that of Shapley and Shubik (1971) in the one-to-one matching\nsetting to the many-to-one matching setting under distributional constraints\nbut also provides a method to compute market equilibria efficiently.",

Interventions such as the\nRooney Rule and its generalizations, which require the decision maker to select\nat least a specified number of individuals from each affected group, have been\nproposed to mitigate the adverse effects of implicit bias in selection. Recent\nworks have established that such lower-bound constraints can be very effective\nin improving aggregate utility in the case when each individual belongs to at\nmost one affected group. However, in several settings, individuals may belong\nto multiple affected groups and, consequently, face more extreme implicit bias\ndue to this intersectionality. We consider independently drawn utilities and\nshow that, in the intersectional case, the aforementioned non-intersectional\nconstraints can only recover part of the total utility achievable in the\nabsence of implicit bias. On the other hand, we show that if one includes\nappropriate lower-bound constraints on the intersections, almost all the\nutility achievable in the absence of implicit bias can be recovered.

We model\nbeliefs as urns where red balls represent one possible value of the state and\nblue balls the other value. The model revolves purely around communication and\nbeliefs dynamics. Communication happens in discrete time and, at each period,\nagents draw and display one ball from their urn with replacement. Then, they\nreinforce their urns by adding balls of the colors drawn by their neighbors. We\nshow that for any network structure, this process converges almost-surely to a\nstable state. Futher, we show that if the communication network is connected,\nthis stable state is such that all urns have the same proportion of balls. This\nresult strengthens the main convergence properties of non-Bayesian learning\nmodels. Yet, contrary to those models, we show that this limit proportion is a\nfull-support random variable. This implies that an arbitrarily small proportion\nof misinformed agents can substantially change the value of the limit\nconsensus.

Finally, our system adds a third parameter $b \\in (0,1)$,\nwhich captures the asymmetry of the cost functions of the two resources. It is\nthe proportion of the agents using the first resource at Nash equilibrium, with\n$b=1/2$ capturing a symmetric network.\n  Within this simple framework, we show a plethora of bifurcation phenomena\nwhere behavioral dynamics destabilize from global convergence to equilibrium,\nto limit cycles or even (formally proven) chaos as a function of the parameters\n$a$, $b$ and $\\sigma$.

        "abstract": "Periodic double auctions (PDA) have applications in many areas such as in\ne-commerce, intra-day equity markets, and day-ahead energy markets in\nsmart-grids. While the trades accomplished using PDAs are worth trillions of\ndollars, finding a reliable bidding strategy in such auctions is still a\nchallenge as it requires the consideration of future auctions. A participating\nbuyer in a PDA has to design its bidding strategy by planning for current and\nfuture auctions. Many equilibrium-based bidding strategies proposed are complex\nto use in real-time. In the current exposition, we propose a scale-based\nbidding strategy for buyers participating in PDA. We first present an\nequilibrium analysis for single-buyer single-seller multi-unit single-shot\nk-Double auctions. Specifically, we analyze the situation when a seller and a\nbuyer trade two identical units of quantity in a double auction where both the\nbuyer and the seller deploy a simple, scale-based bidding strategy. The\nequilibrium analysis becomes intractable as the number of participants\nincreases. To be useful in more complex settings such as wholesale markets in\nsmart-grids, we model equilibrium bidding strategy as a learning problem. We\ndevelop a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based learning strategy,\nDDPGBBS, for a participating agent in PDAs to suggest an action at any auction\ninstance. DDPGBBS, which empirically follows the obtained theoretical\nequilibrium, is easily extendable when the number of buyers/sellers increases.\nWe take Power Trading Agent Competition's (PowerTAC) wholesale market PDA as a\ntestbed to evaluate our novel bidding strategy. We benchmark our DDPG based\nstrategy against several baselines and state-of-the-art bidding strategies of\nthe PowerTAC wholesale market PDA and demonstrate the efficacy of DDPGBBS\nagainst several benchmarked strategies.",

Thus a\ntrade-off between these two extreme cases has caught attention from many\nresearchers. In this paper, we obtain a new value for cooperative games with\ntransferable utilities that adopts egalitarianism in smaller coalitions on one\nhand and on the other hand takes care of the players' marginal productivity in\nsufficiently large coalitions. Our value is identical with the Shapley value on\none extreme and the Equal Division rule on the other extreme.

If we follow a Nash equilibrium and opponents\nare irrational (or follow strategies from a different Nash equilibrium), then\nwe may obtain an extremely low payoff. On the other hand, a maximin strategy\nassumes that all opposing agents are playing to minimize our payoff (even if it\nis not in their best interest), and ensures the maximal possible worst-case\npayoff, but results in exceedingly conservative play. We propose a new solution\nconcept called safe equilibrium that models opponents as behaving rationally\nwith a specified probability and behaving potentially arbitrarily with the\nremaining probability. We prove that a safe equilibrium exists in all\nstrategic-form games (for all possible values of the rationality parameters),\nand prove that its computation is PPAD-hard. We present exact algorithms for\ncomputing a safe equilibrium in both 2 and $n$-player games, as well as\nscalable approximation algorithms.",

The new\nframework is motivated by the need to transport resources of different types\nsimultaneously, i.e., in single trips, from specified origins to destinations;\nsimilarly, in economic matching, one needs to couple two groups, e.g., buyers\nand sellers, by equating supplies and demands of different goods at the same\ntime. The mathematical structure of simultaneous transport is very different\nfrom the classic setting of optimal transport, leading to many new challenges.\nThe Monge and Kantorovich formulations are contrasted and connected. Existence\nconditions and duality formulas are established. More interestingly, by\nconnecting SOT to a natural relaxation of martingale optimal transport (MOT),\nwe introduce the MOT-SOT parity, which allows for explicit solutions of SOT in\nmany interesting cases.",

Hence,\nthe development of an information-systems defense capability through\ncyber-security investment is a prerequisite. The question of how to determine\nthe optimal amount to invest in cyber-security has been widely investigated in\nthe literature. In this respect, the Gordon-Loeb model and its extensions\nreceived wide-scale acceptance. However, such models predominantly rely on\nrestrictive assumptions that are not adapted for analyzing dynamic aspects of\ncyber-security investment. Yet, understanding such dynamic aspects is a key\nfeature for studying cyber-security investment in the context of a fast-paced\nand continuously evolving technological landscape. We propose an extension of\nthe Gordon-Loeb model by considering multi-period and relaxing the assumption\nof a continuous security-breach probability function. Such theoretical\nadaptations enable to capture dynamic aspects of cyber-security investment such\nas the advent of a disruptive technology and its investment consequences. Such\na proposed extension of the Gordon-Loeb model gives room for a hypothetical\ndecrease of the optimal level of cyber-security investment, due to a potential\ntechnological shift. While we believe our framework should be generalizable\nacross the cyber-security milieu, we illustrate our approach in the context of\ncritical-infrastructure protection, where security-cost reductions related to\nrisk events are of paramount importance as potential losses reach unaffordable\nproportions. Moreover, despite the fact that some technologies are considered\nas disruptive and thus promising for critical-infrastructure protection, their\neffects on cyber-security investment have been discussed little.",

        "abstract": "We revisit the setting of fairly allocating indivisible items when agents\nhave different weights representing their entitlements. First, we propose a\nparameterized family of relaxations for weighted envy-freeness and the same for\nweighted proportionality; the parameters indicate whether smaller-weight or\nlarger-weight agents should be given a higher priority. We show that each\nnotion in these families can always be satisfied, but any two cannot\nnecessarily be fulfilled simultaneously. We then introduce an intuitive\nweighted generalization of maximin share fairness and establish the optimal\napproximation of it that can be guaranteed. Furthermore, we characterize the\nimplication relations between the various weighted fairness notions introduced\nin this and prior work, and relate them to the lower and upper quota axioms\nfrom apportionment.",

        "abstract": "In statistical decision theory, a model is said to be Pareto optimal (or\nadmissible) if no other model carries less risk for at least one state of\nnature while presenting no more risk for others. How can you rationally\naggregate/combine a finite set of Pareto optimal models while preserving Pareto\nefficiency? This question is nontrivial because weighted model averaging does\nnot, in general, preserve Pareto efficiency. This paper presents an answer in\nfour logical steps: (1) A rational aggregation rule should preserve Pareto\nefficiency (2) Due to the complete class theorem, Pareto optimal models must be\nBayesian, i.e., they minimize a risk where the true state of nature is averaged\nwith respect to some prior. Therefore each Pareto optimal model can be\nassociated with a prior, and Pareto efficiency can be maintained by aggregating\nPareto optimal models through their priors. (3) A prior can be interpreted as a\npreference ranking over models: prior $\\pi$ prefers model A over model B if the\naverage risk of A is lower than the average risk of B. (4) A\nrational/consistent aggregation rule should preserve this preference ranking:\nIf both priors $\\pi$ and $\\pi'$ prefer model A over model B, then the prior\nobtained by aggregating $\\pi$ and $\\pi'$ must also prefer A over B. Under these\nfour steps, we show that all rational/consistent aggregation rules are as\nfollows: Give each individual Pareto optimal model a weight, introduce a weak\norder/ranking over the set of Pareto optimal models, aggregate a finite set of\nmodels S as the model associated with the prior obtained as the weighted\naverage of the priors of the highest-ranked models in S. This result shows that\nall rational/consistent aggregation rules must follow a generalization of\nhierarchical Bayesian modeling. Following our main result, we present\napplications to Kernel smoothing, time-depreciating models, and voting\nmechanisms.",

        "abstract": "In a crowdsourcing contest, a principal holding a task posts it to a crowd.\nPeople in the crowd then compete with each other to win the rewards. Although\nin real life, a crowd is usually networked and people influence each other via\nsocial ties, existing crowdsourcing contest theories do not aim to answer how\ninterpersonal relationships influence people's incentives and behaviors and\nthereby affect the crowdsourcing performance. In this work, we novelly take\npeople's social ties as a key factor in the modeling and designing of agents'\nincentives in crowdsourcing contests. We establish two contest mechanisms by\nwhich the principal can impel the agents to invite their neighbors to\ncontribute to the task. The first mechanism has a symmetric Bayesian Nash\nequilibrium, and it is very simple for agents to play and easy for the\nprincipal to predict the contest performance. The second mechanism has an\nasymmetric Bayesian Nash equilibrium, and agents' behaviors in equilibrium show\na vast diversity which is strongly related to their social relations. The\nBayesian Nash equilibrium analysis of these new mechanisms reveals that,\nbesides agents' intrinsic abilities, the social relations among them also play\na central role in decision-making. Moreover, we design an effective algorithm\nto automatically compute the Bayesian Nash equilibrium of the invitation\ncrowdsourcing contest and further adapt it to a large graph dataset. Both\ntheoretical and empirical results show that the new invitation crowdsourcing\ncontests can substantially enlarge the number of participants, whereby the\nprincipal can obtain significantly better solutions without a large\nadvertisement expenditure.",

        "abstract": "Revision game is a very new model formulating the real-time situation where\nplayers dynamically prepare and revise their actions in advance before a\ndeadline when payoffs are realized. It is at the cutting edge of dynamic game\ntheory and can be applied in many real-world scenarios, such as eBay auction,\nstock market, election, online games, crowdsourcing, etc. In this work, we\nnovelly identify a class of strategies for revision games which are called\nLimited Retaliation strategies. An limited retaliation strategy stipulates\nthat, (1) players first follow a recommended cooperative plan; (2) if anyone\ndeviates from the plan, the limited retaliation player retaliates by using the\ndefection action for a limited duration; (3) after the retaliation, the limited\nretaliation player returns to the cooperative plan. A limited retaliation\nstrategy has three key features. It is cooperative, sustaining a high level of\nsocial welfare. It is vengeful, deterring the opponent from betrayal by\nthreatening with a future retaliation. It is yet forgiving, since it resumes\ncooperation after a proper retaliation. The cooperativeness and vengefulness\nmake it constitute cooperative subgame perfect equilibrium, while the\nforgiveness makes it tolerate occasional mistakes. limited retaliation\nstrategies show significant advantages over Grim Trigger, which is currently\nthe only known strategy for revision games. Besides its contribution as a new\nrobust and welfare-optimizing equilibrium strategy, our results about limited\nretaliation strategy can also be used to explain how easy cooperation can\nhappen, and why forgiveness emerges in real-world multi-agent interactions. In\naddition, limited retaliation strategies are simple to derive and\ncomputationally efficient, making it easy for algorithm design and\nimplementation in many multi-agent systems.",

CMWU achieves constant\nregret of $\\ln(m)/\\eta$ in all normal-form games with m actions and fixed\nstep-sizes $\\eta$. Although CMWU encodes in its definition a fixed point\ncomputation, which in principle could result in dynamics that are neither\ncomputationally efficient nor uncoupled, we show that both of these issues can\nbe largely circumvented. Specifically, as long as the step-size $\\eta$ is upper\nbounded by $\\frac{1}{(n-1)V}$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $[0,V]$ is\nthe payoff range, then the CMWU updates can be computed linearly fast via a\ncontraction map. This implementation results in an uncoupled online learning\ndynamic that admits a $O (\\log T)$-sparse sub-sequence where each agent\nexperiences at most $O(nV\\log m)$ regret. This implies that the CMWU dynamics\nconverge with rate $O(nV \\log m \\log T / T)$ to a \\textit{Coarse Correlated\nEquilibrium}.

First, it\nreports on a new experimental design with a forced and a non-forced general\nchoice treatment where the 282 subjects in the sample were allowed to choose\n*multiple* gift-card bundles from each menu they saw. Second, it analyses the\ncollected data with a new non-parametric combinatorial-optimization method that\nallows to compare the goodness-of-fit of utility maximization to that of models\nof undominated or dominant choice with incomplete preferences, in each case\nwith or without indifferences. Most subjects in the sample are\nwell-approximated by some indifference-permitting instance of those three\nmodels. Furthermore, the model-specific preference recovery typically elicits a\nunique preference relation with a non-trivial indifference part and, where\nrelevant, a distinct indecisiveness part. The two kinds of distinctions between\nindifference and indecisiveness uncovered herein are theory-guided and\ndocumented empirically for the first time.

Similarly, a natural notion of rationality for aggregating preferences\nof ensembles of experts is that, for all (possibly aggregated) experts $A$ and\n$B$, and all possible choices $x$ and $y$, if both $A$ and $B$ prefer $x$ over\n$y$, then the expert obtained by aggregating $A$ and $B$ must also prefer $x$\nover $y$. Rational aggregation is an important element of uncertainty\nquantification, and it lies behind many seemingly different results in economic\ntheory: spanning social choice, belief formation, and individual decision\nmaking. Three examples of rational aggregation rules are as follows. (1) Give\neach individual model (expert) a weight (a score) and use weighted averaging to\naggregate individual or finite ensembles of models (experts). (2) Order/rank\nindividual model (expert) and let the aggregation of a finite ensemble of\nindividual models (experts) be the highest-ranked individual model (expert) in\nthat ensemble. (3) Give each individual model (expert) a weight, introduce a\nweak order/ranking over the set of models/experts, aggregate $A$ and $B$ as the\nweighted average of the highest-ranked models (experts) in $A$ or $B$.

        "abstract": "We study the mechanism design problem of selling $k$ items to unit-demand\nbuyers with private valuations for the items. A buyer either participates\ndirectly in the auction or is represented by an intermediary, who represents a\nsubset of buyers. Our goal is to design robust mechanisms that are independent\nof the demand structure (i.e. how the buyers are partitioned across\nintermediaries), and perform well under a wide variety of possible contracts\nbetween intermediaries and buyers.\n  We first study the case of $k$ identical items where each buyer draws its\nprivate valuation for an item i.i.d. from a known $\\lambda$-regular\ndistribution. We construct a robust mechanism that, independent of the demand\nstructure and under certain conditions on the contracts between intermediaries\nand buyers, obtains a constant factor of the revenue that the mechanism\ndesigner could obtain had she known the buyers' valuations. In other words, our\nmechanism's expected revenue achieves a constant factor of the optimal welfare,\nregardless of the demand structure. Our mechanism is a simple posted-price\nmechanism that sets a take-it-or-leave-it per-item price that depends on $k$\nand the total number of buyers, but does not depend on the demand structure or\nthe downstream contracts.\n  Next we generalize our result to the case when the items are not identical.\nWe assume that the item valuations are separable. For this case, we design a\nmechanism that obtains at least a constant fraction of the optimal welfare, by\nusing a menu of posted prices. This mechanism is also independent of the demand\nstructure, but makes a relatively stronger assumption on the contracts between\nintermediaries and buyers, namely that each intermediary prefers outcomes with\na higher sum of utilities of the subset of buyers represented by it.",

We show that imposing strategyproofness renders many of the\naxioms to be equivalent: the family of mechanisms that satisfy proportionality,\nunanimity, and strategyproofness is equivalent to the family of mechanisms that\nsatisfy UFS and strategyproofness, which, in turn, is equivalent to the family\nof mechanisms that satisfy PF and strategyproofness. Furthermore, there is a\nunique such mechanism: the Uniform Phantom mechanism, which is studied in\nFreeman et al. (2021). We also characterize the outcomes of the Uniform Phantom\nmechanism as the unique (pure) equilibrium outcome for any mechanism that\nsatisfies continuity, strict monotonicity, and UFS. Finally, we analyze the\napproximation guarantees, in terms of optimal social welfare and minimum total\ncost, obtained by mechanisms that are strategyproof and satisfy each\nproportionality-based fairness axiom. We show that the Uniform Phantom\nmechanism provides the best approximation of the optimal social welfare (and\nalso minimum total cost) among all mechanisms that satisfy UFS.",

The notion of fairness we adopt is\nthat of core stability from cooperative game theory: No subset of voters should\nbe able to choose another blocking committee of proportionally smaller size\nthat provides strictly larger utility to all voters that deviate. The core\nprovides a strong notion of fairness, subsuming other notions that have been\nwidely studied in computational social choice.\n  It is well-known that an exact core need not exist even when utility\nfunctions of the voters are additive across candidates. We therefore relax the\nproblem to allow approximation: Voters can only deviate to the blocking\ncommittee if after they choose any extra candidate (called an additament),\ntheir utility still increases by an $\\alpha$ factor. If no blocking committee\nexists under this definition, we call this an $\\alpha$-core.\n  Our main result is that an $\\alpha$-core, for $\\alpha < 67.37$, always exists\nwhen utilities of the voters are arbitrary monotone submodular functions, and\nthis can be computed in polynomial time. This result improves to $\\alpha <\n9.27$ for additive utilities, albeit without the polynomial time guarantee. Our\nresults are a significant improvement over prior work that only shows\nlogarithmic approximations for the case of additive utilities. We complement\nour results with a lower bound of $\\alpha > 1.015$ for submodular utilities,\nand a lower bound of any function in the number of voters and candidates for\ngeneral monotone utilities.",

For\nsuch a dynamic model, we design a mechanism that decides not only which agents\nto match, but also when to match them, to minimize the expected number of\nunmatched agents. The main contribution of this paper is to achieve theoretical\nbounds on the performance of local mechanisms with different timing properties.\nWe show that an algorithm that waits to thicken the market, called the\n$\\textit{Patient}$ algorithm, is exponentially better than the\n$\\textit{Greedy}$ algorithm, i.e., an algorithm that matches agents greedily.\nThis means that waiting has substantial benefits on maximizing a matching over\na bipartite network. We remark that the Patient algorithm requires the planner\nto identify agents who are about to leave the market, and, under the\nrequirement, the Patient algorithm is shown to be an optimal algorithm. We also\nshow that, without the requirement, the Greedy algorithm is almost optimal. In\naddition, we consider the $\\textit{1-sided algorithms}$ where only an agent on\none side can attempt to match. This models a practical matching market such as\na freight exchange market and a labor market where only agents on one side can\nmake a decision. For this setting, we prove that the Greedy and Patient\nalgorithms admit the same performance, that is, waiting to thicken the market\nis not valuable. This conclusion is in contrast to the case where agents on\nboth sides can make a decision and the non-bipartite case by [Akbarpour et\nal.,$~\\textit{Journal of Political Economy}$, 2020].",

        "abstract": "This study develops an economic model for a social planner who prioritizes\nhealth over short-term wealth accumulation during a pandemic. Agents are\nconnected through a weighted undirected network of contacts, and the planner's\nobjective is to determine the policy that contains the spread of infection\nbelow a tolerable incidence level, and that maximizes the present discounted\nvalue of real income, in that order of priority. The optimal unique policy\ndepends both on the configuration of the contact network and the tolerable\ninfection incidence. Comparative statics analyses are conducted: (i) they\nreveal the tradeoff between the economic cost of the pandemic and the infection\nincidence allowed; and (ii) they suggest a correlation between different\nmeasures of network centrality and individual lockdown probability with the\ncorrelation increasing with the tolerable infection incidence level. Using\nunique data on the networks of nursing and long-term homes in the U.S., we\ncalibrate our model at the state level and estimate the tolerable COVID-19\ninfection incidence level. We find that laissez-faire (more tolerance to the\nvirus spread) pandemic policy is associated with an increased number of deaths\nin nursing homes and higher state GDP growth. In terms of the death count,\nlaissez-faire is more harmful to nursing homes than more peripheral in the\nnetworks, those located in deprived counties, and those who work for a profit.\nWe also find that U.S. states with a Republican governor have a higher level of\ntolerable incidence, but policies tend to converge with high death count.",

This we model by considering multi-phase trials with\ndifferent experiments conducted based on the outcomes of prior experiments. In\ncontrast to most of the literature, we consider the problem with constraints on\nsignals imposed on the sender. This we achieve by fixing some of the\nexperiments in an exogenous manner; these are called determined experiments.\nThis modeling helps us understand real-world situations where this occurs:\ne.g., multi-phase drug trials where the FDA determines some of the experiments,\nfunding of a startup by a venture capital firm, start-up acquisition by big\nfirms where late-stage assessments are determined by the potential acquirer,\nmulti-round job interviews where the candidates signal initially by presenting\ntheir qualifications but the rest of the screening procedures are determined by\nthe interviewer. The non-determined experiments (signals) in the multi-phase\ntrial are to be chosen by the sender in order to persuade the receiver best.\nWith a binary state of the world, we start by deriving the optimal signaling\npolicy in the only non-trivial configuration of a two-phase trial with\nbinary-outcome experiments. We then generalize to multi-phase trials with\nbinary-outcome experiments where the determined experiments can be placed at\nany chosen node in the trial tree. Here we present a dynamic programming\nalgorithm to derive the optimal signaling policy that uses the two-phase trial\nsolution's structural insights. We also contrast the optimal signaling policy\nstructure with classical Bayesian persuasion strategies to highlight the impact\nof the signaling constraints on the sender.",

The principal\nknows the reward of the task and provides information to the agent over time in\norder to motivate effort. We derive the optimal information policy in closed\nform and thus identify two conditions, each of which guarantees that delayed\ndisclosure is valuable. First, if the principal is impatient compared to the\nagent, she prefers the front-loaded effort schedule induced by delayed\ndisclosure. In a stationary environment, delayed disclosure is beneficial if\nand only if the principal is less patient than the agent. Second, if the\nenvironment makes the agent become pessimistic over time in absence of any\ninformation disclosure, then providing delayed news can counteract this\ndownward trend in the agent's belief and encourage the agent to work longer.\nNotably, the level of patience remains a crucial determinant of the optimal\npolicy structure.",

Interestingly, this method can be seen as a rotated \"surprisingly\npopular\". It is based on a new clustering method, Determinant MaxImization\n(DMI)-clustering, and a key conceptual idea that information elicitation\nwithout ground-truth can be seen as a clustering problem. Of independent\ninterest, DMI-clustering is a general clustering method that aims to maximize\nthe volume of the simplex consisting of each cluster's mean multiplying the\nproduct of the cluster sizes. We show that DMI-clustering is invariant to any\nnon-degenerate affine transformation for all data points. When the data point's\ndimension is a constant, DMI-clustering can be solved in polynomial time. In\ngeneral, we present a simple heuristic for DMI-clustering which is very similar\nto Lloyd's algorithm for k-means. Additionally, we also apply the clustering\nidea in the single-task setting and use the spectral method to propose a new\naggregation method that utilizes the second-moment information elicited from\nthe crowds.",

We show how to compute the\nexpected revenue of the clairvoyant firm for a class of rational discrete\nchoice models, and develop prophet-type inequalities that provide performance\nguarantees for the expected revenue of the traditional assortment optimization\nfirm (a TAOP firm) relative to the clairvoyant firm, and therefore to any\neffort to personalize assortments. In particular, we show that the expected\nrevenue of the clairvoyant firm cannot exceed twice the expected revenue of the\nTAOP for the RCS model, the MNL, the GAM and the Nested Logit Model. On the\nother hand, there are random utility models for which personalized assortments\ncan earn up to $n$ times more than a TAOP firm, where $n$ is the number of\nproducts. Our numerical studies indicate that when the mean utilities of the\nproducts are heterogeneous among consumer types, and the variance of the\nutilities is small, firms can gain substantial benefits from personalized\nassortments. We support these observations, and others, with theoretical\nfindings. While the consumers surplus can potentially be larger under\npersonalized assortments, clairvoyant firms with pricing power can extract all\nsurplus, and earn arbitrarily more than traditional firms that optimize over\nprices but do not personalize them. For the price-aware MNL, however, a\nclairvoyant firm can earn at most $e$ times more than a traditional firm.",

Specifically, consumers' failure to fully internalize knowledge\nspillover when bearing privacy costs, combined with firms' market power,\nunderprice data and inefficiently limit their supply, leading to\nunderemployment in the innovation sector and a suboptimal long-run growth.\nImproving data usage efficiency is ineffective in mitigating the\nunderutilization of data, but interventions in the data market and direct\nsubsidies hold promises.",

It is shown that the optimal\nprosumer decision has three modes: (a) the net-consuming mode where the\nprosumer consumes more than its behind-the-meter distributed energy resource\n(DER) production when the DER production is below a predetermined lower\nthreshold, (b) the net-producing mode where the prosumer consumes less than its\nDER production when the DER production is above a predetermined upper\nthreshold, and (c) the net-zero energy mode where the prosumer's consumption\nmatches to its DER generation when its DER production is between the lower and\nupper thresholds. Both thresholds are obtained in closed-form. Next, we analyze\nthe regulator's rate-setting process that determines NEM X parameters such as\nretail/sell rates, fixed charges, and price differentials in time-of-use\ntariffs' on and off-peak periods. A stochastic Ramsey pricing program that\nmaximizes social welfare subject to the revenue break-even constraint for the\nregulated utility is formulated. Performance of several NEM X policies is\nevaluated using real and synthetic data to illuminate impacts of NEM policy\ndesigns on social welfare, cross-subsidies of prosumers by consumers, and\npayback time of DER investments that affect long-run DER adoptions.",

Our solution is valid when not at equilibrium and can be used to\nexemplify path-dependent behaviours of the binary decision model. The solution\nis computationally fast and is indistinguishable from Monte Carlo simulation.\nWell-known metastable effects are observed in regions of the model's parameter\nspace where agent rationality is above a critical value, and we calculate the\ntime scale at which equilibrium is reached from first passage time theory to a\nmuch greater approximation than has been previously conducted. In addition to\nconsidering selfish agents, who only care to maximise their own utility, we\nconsider altruistic agents who make decisions on the basis of maximising global\nutility. Curiously, we find that although altruistic agents coalesce more\nstrongly on a particular decision, thereby increasing their utility in the\nshort-term, they are also more prone to being subject to non-optimal metastable\nregimes as compared to selfish agents. The method used for this solution can be\neasily extended to other binary decision models, including Kirman's ant model,\nand under reinterpretation also provides a time-dependent solution to the\nmean-field Ising model. Finally, we use our time-dependent solution to\nconstruct a likelihood function that can be used on non-equilibrium data for\nmodel calibration. This is a rare finding, since often calibration in economic\nagent based models must be done without an explicit likelihood function. From\nsimulated data, we show that even with a well-defined likelihood function,\nmodel calibration is difficult unless one has access to data representative of\nthe underlying model.",

The UTXO design of Bitcoin exhibits partially characteristics of a\ntoken-based system and partially characteristics of an account-based system. A\ndiscussion on the difficulty to implement the economic notion of tokens in the\ndigital domain, along with an exposition of the design of UTXO, is given in\norder to discuss why UTXO-based systems should be viewed as account-based\naccording to the classical economic notion. Besides, a detailed comparison\nbetween UTXO-based systems and account-based systems is presented. Using the\ndata structure of the system state representation as the defining feature to\ndistinguish digital token-based and account-based systems is therefore\nsuggested.

Among others, one direct\nmotivation of our model is the ad auction in which many ad platforms today\nelicit from each bidder not only their private value per conversion but also\ntheir private information about Internet users (e.g., user activities on the\nadvertiser's websites) in order to improve the platform's estimation of\nconversion rates.\n  We show that in this new setup, it is still possible to design mechanisms\nthat are both Incentive and Information Compatible (IIC). We develop two\ndifferent black-box transformations, which convert any mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$\nfor classic bidders to a mechanism $\\bar{\\mathcal{M}}$ for strategically\nreticent bidders, based on either outcome of expectation or expectation of\noutcome, respectively.

We show that for a suitable choice of\nutility functions, PAP is a convex optimization problem. Further, we analyze\nthe structure of the PAP and provide sufficient conditions under which the\noptimal solution is an increasing function of the jamming power observed by the\nradar; this enables computation of the radar's optimal ECCM within the class of\nincreasing affine functions at a low computation cost.

Here, we introduce a formal game-theoretic model of engagement with\nnews stories that captures the strategic interplay between (mis)information\nconsumers and producers. A key insight from the model is that observed patterns\nof engagement do not necessarily reflect the preferences of consumers. This is\nbecause producers seeking to promote misinformation can use strategies that\nlead moderately inattentive readers to engage more with false stories than true\nones -- even when readers prefer more accurate over less accurate information.\nWe then empirically test people's preferences for accuracy in the news. In\nthree studies, we find that people strongly prefer to click and share news they\nperceive as more accurate -- both in a general population sample, and in a\nsample of users recruited through Twitter who had actually shared links to\nmisinformation sites online. Despite this preference for accurate news -- and\nconsistent with the predictions of our model -- we find markedly different\nengagement patterns for articles from misinformation versus mainstream news\nsites. Using 1,000 headlines from 20 misinformation and 20 mainstream news\nsites, we compare Facebook engagement data with 20,000 accuracy ratings\ncollected in a survey experiment. Engagement with a headline is negatively\ncorrelated with perceived accuracy for misinformation sites, but positively\ncorrelated with perceived accuracy for mainstream sites.

Marriage is implemented in the model by adding\nthe decision of stopping searching for a better mate when the affinity between\na couple is higher than a certain fixed amount. We show that the average\nutility in the system with marriage can be higher than in the system without\nit. Part of our results can be summarized in what sounds like a piece of\nadvice: don't marry the first person you like and don't search for the love of\nyour life, but get married if you like your partner more than a sigma above\naverage. We also find that the average utility attained in our stochastic model\nis smaller than the one associated with a stable matching achieved using the\nGale-Shapley algorithm. This can be taken as a formal argument in favor of a\ncentral planner (perhaps an app) with the information to coordinate the\nmarriage market in order to set a stable matching. To roughly test the adequacy\nof our model to describe existent societies, we compare the evolution of the\nfraction of married couples in our model with real-world data and obtain good\nagreement.

But after White moves first in chess, if Black has a double\nmove followed by a double move of White and then alternating play, play is more\nbalanced because White does not always tie or lead in moves. Symbolically,\nBalanced Alternation gives the following move sequence: After White's (W)\ninitial move, first Black (B) and then White each have two moves in a row\n(BBWW), followed by the alternating sequence, beginning with W, which\naltogether can be written as WB/BW/WB/WB/WB...

Because Balanced Alternation\nlies between the standard sequence, which favors White, and a comparable\nsequence that favors Black, it is highly likely to produce a draw with optimal\nplay, rendering chess fairer. This conclusion is supported by a computer\nanalysis of chess openings and how they would play out under Balanced\nAlternation.",

The requirement that a collective choice rule (CCR) be representable by\nthe AS model captures a key insight of IIA but is weaker than IIA; yet it is\nstronger than what is known in the literature as weak IIA (two profiles alike\non $x,y$ cannot have opposite strict social preferences on $x$ and $y$). In\naddition to motivating violations of IIA, the AS model makes intelligible\nviolations of another Arrovian assumption: the negative transitivity of the\nstrict social preference relation $P$. While previous literature shows that\nonly weakening IIA to weak IIA or only weakening negative transitivity of $P$\nto acyclicity still leads to impossibility theorems, we show that jointly\nweakening IIA to AS representability and weakening negative transitivity of $P$\nleads to no such impossibility theorems.

Each quintuple is\nunderstood to list a player, a situation (that is, a name for an information\nset), a decision node, an action, and a successor node. Accordingly, the axioms\nare understood to specify abstract relationships between players, situations,\nnodes, and actions. Such an extensive form is called a \"pentaform\". Finally, a\n\"pentaform game\" is defined to be a pentaform together with utility functions.\n  To ground this new specification in the literature, the paper defines the\nconcept of a \"traditional game\" to represent the literature's many\nspecifications of finite-horizon and infinite-horizon games. The paper's main\nresult is to construct an intuitive bijection between pentaform games and\ntraditional games. Secondary results concern disaggregating pentaforms by\nsubsets, constructing pentaforms by unions, and initial pentaform applications\nto Selten subgames and perfect-recall (an extensive application to dynamic\nprogramming is in Streufert 2023, arXiv:2302.03855).",

We provide sufficient\nconditions under which the optimal mechanism can be implemented via upgrade\npricing -- a menu of product bundles that are nested in the strong set order.\nOur approach exploits duality methods to identify conditions on the\ndistribution of consumer types under which (a) each product is purchased by the\nsame set of buyers as under separate monopoly pricing (though the transfers can\nbe different), and (b) these sets are nested.\n  We exhibit two distinct sets of sufficient conditions. The first set of\nconditions is given by a weak version of monotonicity of types and virtual\nvalues, while maintaining a regularity assumption, i.e., that the\nproduct-by-product revenue curves are single-peaked. The second set of\nconditions establishes the optimality of upgrade pricing for type spaces with\nmonotone marginal rates of substitution (MRS) -- the relative preference ratios\nfor any two products are monotone across types. The monotone MRS condition\nallows us to relax the earlier regularity assumption.\n  Under both sets of conditions, we fully characterize the product bundles and\nprices that form the optimal upgrade pricing menu. Finally, we show that, if\nthe consumer's types are monotone, the seller can equivalently post a vector of\nsingle-item prices: upgrade pricing and separate pricing are equivalent.",

        "abstract": "A prevalent assumption in auction theory is that the auctioneer has full\ncontrol over the market and that the allocation she dictates is final. In\npractice, however, agents might be able to resell acquired items in an\naftermarket. A prominent example is the market for carbon emission allowances.\nThese allowances are commonly allocated by the government using uniform-price\nauctions, and firms can typically trade these allowances among themselves in an\naftermarket that may not be fully under the auctioneer's control. While the\nuniform-price auction is approximately efficient in isolation, we show that\nspeculation and resale in aftermarkets might result in a significant welfare\nloss. Motivated by this issue, we consider three approaches, each ensuring high\nequilibrium welfare in the combined market. The first approach is to adopt\nsmooth auctions such as discriminatory auctions. This approach is robust to\ncorrelated valuations and to participants acquiring information about others'\ntypes. However, discriminatory auctions have several downsides, notably that of\ncharging bidders different prices for identical items, resulting in fairness\nconcerns that make the format unpopular. Two other approaches we suggest are\neither using posted-pricing mechanisms, or using uniform-price auctions with\nanonymous reserves. We show that when using balanced prices, both these\napproaches ensure high equilibrium welfare in the combined market. The latter\nalso inherits many of the benefits from uniform-price auctions such as price\ndiscovery, and can be introduced with a minor modification to auctions\ncurrently in use to sell carbon emission allowances.",

The multiple partners matching game generalizes the matching\ngame by allowing each player to have more than one possibly repeated partner.\nIn this paper, we study profit-sharing in multiple partners matching games. A\ncentral concept for profit-sharing is the core which consists of all possible\nways of distributing the profit among individual players such that the grand\ncoalition remains intact. The core of multiple partners matching games may be\nempty [Deng et al., Algorithmic aspects of the core of combinatorial\noptimization games, Math. Oper.

Thus we study\napproximate core allocations upon which a coalition may be paid less than the\nprofit it makes by seceding from the grand coalition. We provide an LP-based\nmechanism guaranteeing that no coalition is paid less than $2/3$ times the\nprofit it makes on its own. We also show that $2/3$ is the best possible factor\nrelative to the underlying LP-relaxation.

Although stable\nassignment mechanisms presuppose a centralized admissions process, I show that\nstable assignments coincide with equilibria of a decentralized, iterative\nmarket in which schools adjust their admissions standards in pursuit of a\ntarget class size. Moreover, deferred acceptance algorithms for stable\nassignment are a special case of a well-understood price dynamic called\nt\\^{a}tonnement. The second half of the article turns to a parametric\ndistribution of student types that enables explicit computation of the\nequilibrium and is invertible in the schools' preferability parameters.\nApplying this model to a public dataset produces an intuitive ranking of the\npopularity of American universities and a realistic estimate of each school's\ndemand curve, and does so without imposing an equilibrium assumption or\nrequiring the granular student information used in conventional logistic\nregressions.",

Contra this, the most prominent syntax-based solution, the\nFagin-Halpern (FH) model, accounts for this distinction and offers a simple\nrepresentation of awareness, but lacks the intuitiveness of the lattice\nstructure. Here, we combine these two approaches by providing a lattice of\nKripke models, induced by atom subset inclusion, in which uncertainty and\nunawareness are separate. We show our model equivalent to both HMS and FH\nmodels by defining transformations between them which preserve satisfaction of\nformulas of a language for explicit knowledge, and obtain completeness through\nour and HMS' results. Lastly, we prove that the Kripke lattice model can be\nshown equivalent to the FH model (when awareness is propositionally determined)\nalso with respect to the language of the Logic of General Awareness, for which\nthe FH model where originally proposed.",

In this work, we argue\nthat a direct combination of these standard ingredients leads to brittle\nsolution concepts of limited descriptive and prescriptive value. First, we show\nthat rational agents with perfect information produce discontinuities in the\naggregate response to a decision rule that we often do not observe empirically.\nSecond, when any positive fraction of agents is not perfectly strategic,\ndesirable stable points -- where the classifier is optimal for the data it\nentails -- cease to exist. Third, optimal decision rules under standard\nmicrofoundations maximize a measure of negative externality known as social\nburden within a broad class of possible assumptions about agent behavior.\n  Recognizing these limitations we explore alternatives to standard\nmicrofoundations for binary classification. We start by describing a set of\ndesiderata that help navigate the space of possible assumptions about how\nagents respond to a decision rule. In particular, we analyze a natural\nconstraint on feature manipulations, and discuss properties that are sufficient\nto guarantee the robust existence of stable points. Building on these insights,\nwe then propose the noisy response model. Inspired by smoothed analysis and\nempirical observations, noisy response incorporates imperfection in the agent\nresponses, which we show mitigates the limitations of standard\nmicrofoundations. Our model retains analytical tractability, leads to more\nrobust insights about stable points, and imposes a lower social burden at\noptimality.",

A voting method\nsatisfies the property of positive involvement (PI) if for any election in\nwhich a candidate x would be among the winners, adding another voter to the\nelection who ranks x first does not cause x to lose. Surprisingly, a number of\nstandard voting methods violate this natural property. In this paper, we\ninvestigate different ways of measuring the extent to which a voting method\nviolates PI, using computer simulations. We consider the probability (under\ndifferent probability models for preferences) of PI violations in randomly\ndrawn profiles vs. profile-coalition pairs (involving coalitions of different\nsizes). We argue that in order to choose between a voting method that satisfies\nPI and one that does not, we should consider the probability of PI violation\nconditional on the voting methods choosing different winners. We should also\nrelativize the probability of PI violation to what we call voter potency, the\nprobability that a voter causes a candidate to lose. Although absolute\nfrequencies of PI violations may be low, after this conditioning and\nrelativization, we see that under certain voting methods that violate PI, much\nof a voter's potency is turned against them - in particular, against their\ndesire to see their favorite candidate elected.",

However, the mechanism does not have direct access to the\ngraph. Instead, the vertices are partitioned over multiple players (hospitals),\nand each player reports a subset of her vertices to the mechanism. In\nparticular, a player may strategically omit vertices to increase how many of\nher vertices lie on the path returned by the mechanism.\n  Our objective is to find mechanisms that limit incentives for such\nmanipulation while producing long paths. Unfortunately, in worst-case\ninstances, competing with the overall longest path is impossible while\nincentivizing (approximate) truthfulness, i.e., requiring that hiding nodes\ncannot increase a player's utility by more than a factor of $1 + o(1)$. We\ntherefore adopt a semi-random model where a small ($o(n)$) number of random\nedges are added to worst-case instances. While it remains impossible for\ntruthful mechanisms to compete with the overall longest path, we give a\ntruthful mechanism that competes with a weaker but non-trivial benchmark: the\nlength of any path whose subpaths within each player have a minimum average\nlength. In fact, our mechanism satisfies even a stronger notion of\ntruthfulness, which we call matching-time incentive compatibility. This notion\nof truthfulness requires that each player not only reports her nodes truthfully\nbut also does not stop the returned path at any of her nodes in order to divert\nit to a continuation inside her own subgraph.",

Thus, I define a Universal Risk Budgeting scheme that\nweights each risk budget (instead of each capital budget) by its historical\nperformance record (a la Cover). I prove that my scheme is mathematically\nequivalent to a novel type of Cover and Ordentlich 1996 universal portfolio\nthat uses a new family of prior densities that have hitherto not appeared in\nthe literature on universal portfolio theory. I argue that my universal risk\nbudget, so-defined, is a potentially more perspicuous and flexible type of\nuniversal portfolio; it allows the algorithmic trader to incorporate, with\nadvantage, his prior knowledge (or beliefs) about the particular covariance\nstructure of instantaneous asset returns. Say, if there is some dispersion in\nthe volatilities of the available assets, then the uniform (or Dirichlet)\npriors that are standard in the literature will generate a dangerously lopsided\nprior distribution over the possible risk budgets. In the author's opinion, the\nproposed \"Garivaltis prior\" makes for a nice improvement on Cover's timeless\nexpert system (Cover 1991), that is properly agnostic and open (from the very\nget-go) to different risk budgets.

This\nharm may manifest as a gradual degradation of public discourse; but it can also\ntake the form of sudden dramatic events such as the 2021 insurrection on\nCapitol Hill. The platforms themselves are in the best position to prevent the\nspread of disinformation, as they have the best access to relevant data and the\nexpertise to use it. However, mitigating disinformation is costly, not only for\nimplementing detection algorithms or employing manual effort, but also because\nlimiting such highly viral content impacts user engagement and potential\nadvertising revenue. Since the costs of harmful content are borne by other\nentities, the platform will therefore have no incentive to exercise the\nsocially-optimal level of effort. This problem is similar to that of\nenvironmental regulation, in which the costs of adverse events are not directly\nborne by a firm, the mitigation effort of a firm is not observable, and the\ncausal link between a harmful consequence and a specific failure is difficult\nto prove. For environmental regulation, one solution is to perform costly\nmonitoring to ensure that the firm takes adequate precautions according to a\nspecified rule. However, a fixed rule for classifying disinformation becomes\nless effective over time, as bad actors can learn to sequentially and\nstrategically bypass it. Encoding our domain as a Markov decision process, we\ndemonstrate that no penalty based on a static rule, no matter how large, can\nincentivize optimal effort. Penalties based on an adaptive rule can incentivize\noptimal effort, but counter-intuitively, only if the regulator sufficiently\noverreacts to harmful events by requiring a greater-than-optimal level of\neffort. We offer novel insights for the effective regulation of social\nplatforms, highlight inherent challenges, and discuss promising avenues for\nfuture work.",

This paper examines the economic effects of social\ndistancing at the aggregate level, weighing both the benefits and costs to\nprolonged distancing. Specifically we fashion a model of economic recovery when\nthe productive capacity of factors of production is restricted by social\ndistancing, building a system of equations where output growth and social\ndistance changes are interdependent. The model attempts to show the complex\ninteractions between output levels and social distancing, developing cycle\npaths for both variables. Ultimately, however, defying gravity via prolonged\nsocial distancing shows that a lower growth path is inevitable as a result.",

The model investigates\nhow, for a population of myopic agents with homogeneous preferences, changes in\nthe environment caused by current aggregate behavior may affect future payoffs\nand hence alter future behavior. The interaction between the agents is based on\na symmetric two-strategy game with positive externalities and negative feedback\nfrom aggregate behavior to payoffs, so that at every point in time the\npopulation has an incentive to coordinate, whereas over time the more popular\nstrategy becomes less appealing. Under the best response dynamics and the logit\ndynamics with small noise levels the joint trajectories of preferences and\nbehavior converge to closed orbits around the unique steady state, whereas for\nlarge noise levels the steady state of the logit dynamics becomes a sink.

Various\nmechanisms have been proposed in different settings to elicit different types\nof information. But we still lack understanding about when desirable mechanisms\nwill exist for a multi-task peer prediction problem. In this work, we study the\nelicitability of multi-task peer prediction problems. We consider a designer\nwho has certain knowledge about the underlying information structure and wants\nto elicit certain information from a group of participants. Our goal is to\ninfer the possibility of having a desirable mechanism based on the primitives\nof the problem.\n  Our contribution is twofold. First, we provide a characterization of the\nelicitable multi-task peer prediction problems, assuming that the designer only\nuses scoring mechanisms. Scoring mechanisms are the mechanisms that reward\nparticipants' reports for different tasks separately. The characterization uses\na geometric approach based on the power diagram characterization in the\nsingle-task setting ([Lambert and Shoham, 2009, Frongillo and Witkowski,\n2017]). For general mechanisms, we also give a necessary condition for a\nmulti-task problem to be elicitable.\n  Second, we consider the case when the designer aims to elicit some properties\nthat are linear in the participant's posterior about the state of the world. We\nfirst show that in some cases, the designer basically can only elicit the\nposterior itself. We then look into the case when the designer aims to elicit\nthe participants' posteriors. We give a necessary condition for the posterior\nto be elicitable. This condition implies that the mechanisms proposed by Kong\nand Schoenebeck are already the best we can hope for in their setting, in the\nsense that their mechanisms can solve any problem instance that can possibly be\nelicitable.",

The most efficient way to attend to these two\nconcerns is to tax assets of different types separately, rather than having one\ntax on all assets. When assets are created by specialized effort rather than by\nsaving, as with innovations, discoveries of mineral deposits and development of\nunregulated natural monopolies, it is interesting to consider a regime in which\nthe government awards a prize for the creation of the asset and then collects\nthe remaining value of the asset in taxes. Analytically, the prize is like a\nwage after taxes. In this perspective, prizes are awarded based on a variation\non optimal taxation theory, while assets of different types are taxed in\ndivergent ways, depending on their characteristics.

The Human and Resources with MONEY (HARMONEY) economic growth model links\nthese features using a stock and flow consistent framework in physical and\nmonetary units. Via an updated version, we explore the interdependence of\ngrowth and three major structural metrics of an economy. First, we show that\nrelative decoupling of gross domestic product (GDP) from resource consumption\nis an expected pattern that occurs because of physical limits to growth, not a\nresponse to avoid physical limits. While an increase in resource efficiency of\noperating capital does increase the level of relative decoupling, so does a\nchange in pricing from one based on full costs to one based only on marginal\ncosts that neglects depreciation and interest payments leading to higher debt\nratios. Second, if assuming full labor bargaining power for wages, when a\npreviously-growing economy reaches peak resource extraction and GDP, wages\nremain high but profits and debt decline to zero. By removing bargaining power,\nprofits can remain positive at the expense of declining wages. Third, the\ndistribution of intermediate transactions within the input-output table of the\nmodel follows the same temporal pattern as in the post-World War II U.S.\neconomy. These results indicate that the HARMONEY framework enables realistic\ninvestigation of interdependent structural change and trade-offs between\neconomic distribution, size, and resources consumption.",

EIP-1559 suggested making several tightly\ncoupled changes, including the introduction of variable-size blocks, a\nhistory-dependent reserve price, and the burning of a significant portion of\nthe transaction fees. We prove that this new mechanism earns an impressive\nreport card: it satisfies the MMIC and OCA-proofness conditions, and is also\ndominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) except when there is a sudden\ndemand spike.

        "abstract": "The analogies between economics and classical mechanics can be extended from\nconstrained optimization to constrained dynamics by formalizing economic\n(constraint) forces and economic power in analogy to physical (constraint)\nforces in Lagrangian mechanics. In the differential-algebraic equation\nframework of General Constrained Dynamics (GCD), households, firms, banks, and\nthe government employ forces to change economic variables according to their\ndesire and their power to assert their interest. These ex-ante forces are\ncompleted by constraint forces from unanticipated system constraints to yield\nthe ex-post dynamics. The flexible out-of-equilibrium model can combine\nKeynesian concepts such as the balance sheet approach and slow adaptation of\nprices and quantities with bounded rationality (gradient climbing) and\ninteracting agents discussed in behavioral economics and agent-based models.\nThe framework integrates some elements of different schools of thought and\novercomes some restrictions inherent to optimization approaches, such as the\nassumption of markets operating in or close to equilibrium. Depending on the\nparameter choice for power relations and adaptation speeds, the model\nnevertheless can converge to a neoclassical equilibrium, and reacts to an\nausterity shock in a neoclassical or post-Keynesian way.",

We consider the well-known and classic scoring\nrule for achieving diverse representation: the Chamberlin-Courant (CC) or\n$1$-Borda rule, where the score of a committee is the average over the voters,\nof the rank of the best candidate in the committee for that voter; and its\ngeneralization to the average of the top $s$ best candidates, called the\n$s$-Borda rule.\n  Our first result is an improved analysis of the natural and well-studied\ngreedy heuristic. We show that greedy achieves a $\\left(1 -\n\\frac{2}{k+1}\\right)$-approximation to the maximization (or satisfaction)\nversion of CC rule, and a $\\left(1 - \\frac{2s}{k+1}\\right)$-approximation to\nthe $s$-Borda score. Our result improves on the best known approximation\nalgorithm for this problem. We show that these bounds are almost tight.\n  For the dissatisfaction (or minimization) version of the problem, we show\nthat the score of $\\frac{m+1}{k+1}$ can be viewed as an optimal benchmark for\nthe CC rule, as it is essentially the best achievable score of any\npolynomial-time algorithm even when the optimal score is a polynomial factor\nsmaller (under standard computational complexity assumptions). We show that\nanother well-studied algorithm for this problem, called the Banzhaf rule,\nattains this benchmark.\n  We finally show that for the $s$-Borda rule, when the optimal value is small,\nthese algorithms can be improved by a factor of $\\tilde \\Omega(\\sqrt{s})$ via\nLP rounding. Our upper and lower bounds are a significant improvement over\nprevious results, and taken together, not only enable us to perform a finer\ncomparison of greedy algorithms for these problems, but also provide analytic\njustification for using such algorithms in practice.",

It\nalso provides some applications.\n  The category's objects are games, which are understood to be sets of nodes\nwhich have been endowed with edges, information sets, actions, players, and\nutility functions. Its arrows are functions from source nodes to target nodes\nthat preserve the additional structure. For instance, a game's information-set\ncollection is newly regarded as a topological basis for the game's\ndecision-node set, and thus a morphism's continuity serves to preserve\ninformation sets. Given these definitions, a game monomorphism is characterized\nby the property of not mapping two source runs (plays) to the same target run.\nFurther, a game isomorphism is characterized as a bijection whose restriction\nto decision nodes is a homeomorphism, whose induced player transformation is\ninjective, and which strictly preserves the ordinal content of the utility\nfunctions.\n  The category is then applied to some game-theoretic concepts beyond the\ndefinition of a game. A Selten subgame is characterized as a special kind of\ncategorical subgame, and game isomorphisms are shown to preserve strategy sets,\nNash equilibria, Selten subgames, subgame-perfect equilibria,\nperfect-information, and no-absentmindedness. Further, it is shown that the\nfull subcategory for distinguished-action sequence games is essentially wide in\nthe category of all games, and that the full subcategory of action-set games is\nessentially wide in the full subcategory for games with no-absentmindedness.",

It is motivated by the psychology literature of\nlearning through reinforcing good or bad decisions. In a model of an\nenvironment, to learn to make decisions, this AI agent needs to interact with\nits environment and make explorative actions. Each action in a given state\nbrings a reward signal to the agent. These interactive experience is saved in\nthe agent's memory, which is then used to update its subjective belief of the\nworld. The agent's decision-making strategy is formed and adjusted based on\nthis evolving subjective belief. This agent does not only take an action that\nit knows would bring a high reward, it also explores other possibilities. This\nis the process of taking explorative actions, and it ensures that the agent\nnotices changes in its environment and adapt its subjective belief and\ndecisions accordingly. Through a model of stochastic optimal growth, I\nillustrate that the economic agent under this proposed learning structure is\nadaptive to changes in an underlying stochastic process of the economy. AI\nagents can differ in their levels of exploration, which leads to different\nexperience in the same environment. This reflects on to their different\nlearning behaviours and welfare obtained. The chosen economic structure\npossesses the fundamental decision making problems of macroeconomic models,\ni.e., how to make consumption-saving decisions in a lifetime, and it can be\ngeneralised to other decision-making processes and economic models.",

While MMS allocations do not always exist,\nseveral approximation techniques have been developed to ensure that all agents\nreceive a fraction of their maximin share. We focus on an alternative\napproximation notion, based on the population of agents, that seeks to\nguarantee MMS for a fraction of agents. We show that no optimal approximation\nalgorithm can satisfy more than a constant number of agents, and discuss the\nexistence and computation of MMS for all but one agent and its relation to\napproximate MMS guarantees. We then prove the existence of allocations that\nguarantee MMS for $\\frac{2}{3}$ of agents, and devise a polynomial time\nalgorithm that achieves this bound for up to nine agents. A key implication of\nour result is the existence of allocations that guarantee\n$\\text{MMS}^{\\lceil{3n/2}\\rceil}$, i.e., the value that agents receive by\npartitioning the goods into $\\lceil{\\frac{3}{2}n}\\rceil$ bundles, improving the\nbest known guarantee of $\\text{MMS}^{2n-2}$.

        "abstract": "We analyze the optimal information design in a click-through auction with\nfixed valuations per click, but stochastic click-through rates. While the\nauctioneer takes as given the auction rule of the click-through auction, namely\nthe generalized second-price auction, the auctioneer can design the information\nflow regarding the click-through rates among the bidders. A natural requirement\nin this context is to ask for the information structure to be calibrated in the\nlearning sense. With this constraint, the auction needs to rank the ads by a\nproduct of the bid and an unbiased estimator of the click-through rates, and\nthe task of designing an optimal information structure is thus reduced to the\ntask of designing an optimal unbiased estimator.\n  We show that in a symmetric setting with uncertainty about the click-through\nrates, the optimal information structure attains both social efficiency and\nsurplus extraction. The optimal information structure requires private (rather\nthan public) signals to the bidders. It also requires correlated (rather than\nindependent) signals, even when the underlying uncertainty regarding the\nclick-through rates is independent. Beyond symmetric settings, we show that the\noptimal information structure requires partial information disclosure.",

Our algorithmic tools and\nimplementations efficiently handle portfolios with 10000 assets, and compute\nmoments of order k up to 40 in a few seconds, thus handling real-life\nscenarios. We focus on the long-only strategy which is the most common type of\ninvestment, i.e. on portfolios whose weights are non-negative and sum up to 1;\nour approach is readily generalizable. Thus, we leverage a geometric\nrepresentation of the stock market, where the investment set defines a simplex\npolytope.

We introduce closed-form analytic formulas for the first 4 moments of\nthe cross-sectional returns distribution, as well as a novel algorithm to\ncompute all higher moments. We show that the first 4 moments are a direct\nmapping of the asset returns' moments.

In this article, we\nstudy the problem of deriving revenue adequate prices for an electricity\nmarket-clearing model with uncertainties resulting from the use of variable\nrenewable energy sources (VRES). To handle the uncertain nature of the problem,\nwe use a chance-constrained optimization (CCO) approach, which has recently\nbecome very popular choice when constructing dispatch electricity models with\npenetration of VRES (or other sources of uncertainty). Then, we show how prices\nthat satisfy revenue adequacy in expectation for the market administrator, and\ncost recovery in expectation for all conventional and VRES generators, can be\nobtained from the optimal dual variables associated with the deterministic\nequivalent of the CCO market-clearing model. These results constitute a novel\ncontribution to the research of research on revenue adequate, equilibrium, and\nother types of pricing schemes that have been derived in the literature when\nthe market uncertainties are modeled using stochastic or robust optimization\napproaches. Unlike in the stochastic approach, the CCO market-clearing model\nstudied here produces uncertainty uniform real-time prices that do not depend\non the real-time realization of the VRES generation outcomes. To illustrate our\nresults, we consider a case study electricity market, and contrast the market\nprices obtained using a revenue adequate stochastic approach and the proposed\nrevenue adequate CCO approach.",

The power\nindustry has switched to an auction-based allocation system at the onset of\nPhase III of the EU ETS to bring economic efficiency by negating windfall\nprofits that have been resulted from grandfathered allocation of allowances in\nthe previous phases. In this work, we analyze and simulate the interaction of\noligopolistic generators in an electricity market with a game-theoretical\nframework where the electricity and the emissions markets interact in a\ntwo-stage electricity market. For analytical simplicity, we assume a single\nfutures market where the electricity is committed at the futures price, and the\nemissions allowance is contracted in advance, prior to a spot market where the\nenergy and allowances delivery takes place. Moreover, a coherent risk measure\nis applied (Conditional Value at Risk) to model both risk averse and risk\nneutral generators and a two-stage stochastic optimization setting is\nintroduced to deal with the uncertainty of renewable capacity, demand,\ngeneration, and emission costs. The performance of the proposed equilibrium\nmodel and its main properties are examined through realistic numerical\nsimulations.

Important\nexamples include the competitive access to shared resources (e.g., roads,\nenergy, or bandwidth) but also non-engineering domains like epidemic\npropagation and control. These problems are natural to model as mean-field\ngames. Existing mathematical formulations of mean field games have had limited\napplicability in practice, since they require solving non-standard\ninitial-terminal-value problems that are tractable only in limited special\ncases. In this letter, we propose a novel formulation, along with computational\ntools, for a practically relevant class of Dynamic Population Games (DPGs),\nwhich correspond to discrete-time, finite-state-and-action, stationary\nmean-field games. Our main contribution is a mathematical reduction of\nStationary Nash Equilibria (SNE) in DPGs to standard Nash Equilibria (NE) in\nstatic population games. This reduction is leveraged to guarantee the existence\nof a SNE, develop an evolutionary dynamics-based SNE computation algorithm, and\nderive simple conditions that guarantee stability and uniqueness of the SNE.

        "abstract": "We analyze the relation between strategy-proofness and preference reversal in\nthe case that agents may declare indifference. Interestingly, Berga and Moreno\n(2020), have recently derived preference reversal from group strategy-proofness\nof social choice functions on strict preferences domains if the range has no\nmore than three elements. We extend this result and at the same time simplify\nit. Our analysis points out the role of individual strategy-proofness in\nderiving the preference reversal property, giving back to the latter its\noriginal individual nature (cfr. Eliaz, 2004).\n  Moreover, we show that the difficulties Berga and Moreno highlighted relaxing\nthe assumption on the cardinality of the range, disappear under a proper\nassumption on the domain. We introduce the concept of complete sets of\npreferences and show that individual strategy-proofness is sufficient to obtain\nthe preference reversal property when the agents' feasible set of orderings is\ncomplete. This covers interesting cases like single peaked preferences, rich\ndomains admitting regular social choice functions, and universal domains. The\nfact that we use individual rather than group strategy-proofness, allows to get\nimmediately some of the known, and some new, equivalences between individual\nand group strategy-proofness. Finally, we show that group strategy-proofness is\nonly really needed to obtain preference reversal if there are infinitely many\nvoters.",

The rational strategy\nprofile that maximizes the revenue of the auctioneer is the one where each\nbidder makes the highest possible bid that is lower than his valuation of the\nitem. This strategy profile is an equilibrium for a large enough number of\nbidders, regardless of the information released. We compare the number of\nbidders needed for this profile to be an equilibrium under different\ninformation settings. We find that it becomes an equilibrium with fewer bidders\nwhen less additional information is made available to the bidders regarding the\ncompetition. It follows that when the number of bidders is a priori unknown,\nthere are some advantages to the auctioneer to not reveal information.",

        "abstract": "Can egalitarian norms or conventions survive the presence of dominant\nindividuals who are ensured of victory in conflicts? We investigate the\ninteraction of power asymmetry and partner choice in games of conflict over a\ncontested resource. We introduce three models to study the emergence and\nresilience of cooperation among unequals when interaction is random, when\nindividuals can choose their partners, and where power asymmetries dynamically\ndepend on accumulated payoffs. We find that the ability to avoid bullies with\nhigher competitive ability afforded by partner choice mostly restores\ncooperative conventions and that the competitive hierarchy never forms. Partner\nchoice counteracts the hyper dominance of bullies who are isolated in the\nnetwork and eliminates the need for others to coordinate in a coalition. When\ncompetitive ability dynamically depends on cumulative payoffs, complex cycles\nof coupled network-strategy-rank changes emerge. Effective collaborators gain\npopularity (and thus power), adopt aggressive behavior, get isolated, and\nultimately lose power. Neither the network nor behavior converge to a stable\nequilibrium. Despite the instability of power dynamics, the cooperative\nconvention in the population remains stable overall and long-term inequality is\ncompletely eliminated. The interaction between partner choice and dynamic power\nasymmetry is crucial for these results: without partner choice, bullies cannot\nbe isolated, and without dynamic power asymmetry, bullies do not lose their\npower even when isolated. We analytically identify a single critical point that\nmarks a phase transition in all three iterations of our models. This critical\npoint is where the first individual breaks from the convention and cycles start\nto emerge.",

Chapters 3 and 4 argue that despite the fact that the founders\nof the neoclassical school had shown an active interest in social issues,\nnamely worker poverty, the issues of production and distribution became\ndiscussed separately among neoclassicals. Toward the end of the 20th century,\nhowever, there was a renewed awareness within economics of the problem of the\nrelationship between production and distribution. The young Piketty's\nbeginnings as an economist are set against this backdrop. Chapters 5 to 8\nexplain the circumstances of the restoration of classical concerns within the\nneoclassical framework.

We design mechanisms that are cursed ex-post IC, that is, incentivize\nagents to bid their true signal even though they are cursed, while ensuring\nthat the outcome is individually rational -- the price the agents pay is no\nmore than the agents' true value.\n  Since the agents might over-estimate the good's value, such mechanisms might\nrequire the seller to make positive transfers to the agents to prevent agents\nfrom over-paying. For revenue maximization, we give the optimal deterministic\nand anonymous mechanism. For welfare maximization, we require ex-post budget\nbalance (EPBB), as positive transfers might lead to negative revenue. We\npropose a masking operation that takes any deterministic mechanism, and imposes\nthat the seller would not make positive transfers, enforcing EPBB. We show that\nin typical settings, EPBB implies that the mechanism cannot make any positive\ntransfers, implying that applying the masking operation on the fully efficient\nmechanism results in a socially optimal EPBB mechanism. This further implies\nthat if the valuation function is the maximum of agents' signals, the optimal\nEPBB mechanism obtains zero welfare. In contrast, we show that for sum-concave\nvaluations, which include weighted-sum valuations and l_p-norms, the welfare\noptimal EPBB mechanism obtains half of the optimal welfare as the number of\nagents grows large.",

The deposit, but not the bid, is publicly observed during the bidding\nphase of the auction.\n  The visibility of deposits can fundamentally change the strategic structure\nof the auction if bidding happens sequentially: Bidding is costly since deposit\nare costly to make. Thus, deposits can be used as a costly signal for a high\nvaluation. This is the source of multiple inefficiencies: To engage in costly\nsignalling, a bidder who bids first and has a high valuation will generally\nover-deposit in equilibrium, i.e.~deposit more than he will bid. If high\nvaluations are likely there can, moreover, be entry deterrence through high\ndeposits: a bidder who bids first can deter subsequent bidders from entering\nthe auction.

Existing systems sell space using first-price\nauctions; however, users find it difficult to estimate how much they need to\nbid in order to get their transactions accepted onto the chain. If they bid too\nlow, their transactions can have long confirmation times. If they bid too high,\nthey pay larger fees than necessary.\n  In light of these issues, new transaction fee mechanisms have been proposed,\nmost notably EIP-1559, aiming to provide better usability. EIP-1559 is a\nhistory-dependent mechanism that relies on block utilization to adjust a base\nfee. We propose an alternative design -- a {\\em dynamic posted-price mechanism}\n-- which uses not only block utilization but also observable bids from past\nblocks to compute a posted price for subsequent blocks. We show its potential\nto reduce price volatility by providing examples for which the prices of\nEIP-1559 are unstable while the prices of the proposed mechanism are stable.\nMore generally, whenever the demand for the blockchain stabilizes, we ask if\nour mechanism is able to converge to a stable state. Our main result provides\nsufficient conditions in a probabilistic setting for which the proposed\nmechanism is approximately welfare optimal and the prices are stable. Our main\ntechnical contribution towards establishing stability is an iterative algorithm\nthat, given oracle access to a Lipschitz continuous and strictly concave\nfunction $f$, converges to a fixed point of $f$.",

Much research to date focuses on the case of static Fisher markets\nwith full information on buyers' utility functions and item supplies. Motivated\nby real-world markets, we consider an online setting: individuals have linear,\nadditive utility functions; items arrive sequentially and must be allocated and\npriced irrevocably. We define the notion of an online market equilibrium in\nsuch a market as time-indexed allocations and prices which guarantee buyer\noptimality and market clearance in hindsight. We propose a simple, scalable and\ninterpretable allocation and pricing dynamics termed as PACE. When items are\ndrawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution (with a possibly continuous support),\nwe show that PACE leads to an online market equilibrium asymptotically. In\nparticular, PACE ensures that buyers' time-averaged utilities converge to the\nequilibrium utilities w.r.t. a static market with item supplies being the\nunknown distribution and that buyers' time-averaged expenditures converge to\ntheir per-period budget. Hence, many desirable properties of market\nequilibrium-based fair division such as no envy, Pareto optimality, and the\nproportional-share guarantee are also attained asymptotically in the online\nsetting. Next, we extend the dynamics to handle quasilinear buyer utilities,\nwhich gives the first online algorithm for computing first-price pacing\nequilibria. Finally, numerical experiments on real and synthetic datasets show\nthat the dynamics converges quickly under various metrics.",

Under\nthe assumption of perfect competition, we prove the equivalence of the\ncentrally-solved market-clearing optimization problem to a competitive spatial\nprice equilibrium involving a set of rational and self-interested participants\nand a price setter. Finally, under common assumptions, we prove that moving\ntowards conic markets does not incur the loss of desirable economic properties\nof markets, namely market efficiency, cost recovery and revenue adequacy. Our\nnumerical studies focus on the specific use case of uncertainty-aware market\ndesign and demonstrate that the proposed conic market brings advantages over\nexisting alternatives within the linear programming market framework.",

A rich\nproduct line allows firms to better tailor products to consumers' tastes, but\nthe mere choice of a product carries valuable information about consumers that\ncan be leveraged for price discrimination. We study this trade-off in an\nupstream-downstream model, where a consumer buys a good of variable quality\nupstream, followed by an indivisible good downstream.

Though it originated from\nmathematics and later from economics, the model is very enlightening in many\naspects that we shall highlight in this review. It is called The Stable\nMarriage Problem (though the marriage metaphor can be generalized to many other\ncontexts), and it consists of matching men and women, considering\npreference-lists where individuals express their preference over the members of\nthe opposite gender. This problem appeared for the first time in 1962 in the\nseminal paper of Gale and Shapley and has aroused interest in many fields of\nscience, including economics, game theory, computer science, etc. Recently it\nhas also attracted many physicists who, using the powerful tools of statistical\nmechanics, have also approached it as an optimization problem. Here we present\na complete overview of the Stable Marriage Problem emphasizing its\nmultidisciplinary aspect, and reviewing the key results in the disciplines that\nit has influenced most. We focus, in particular, in the old and recent results\nachieved by physicists, finally introducing two new promising models inspired\nby the philosophy of the Stable Marriage Problem. Moreover, we present an\ninnovative reinterpretation of the problem, useful to highlight the\nrevolutionary role of information in the contemporary economy.",

        "abstract": "I introduce PRZI (Parameterised-Response Zero Intelligence), a new form of\nzero-intelligence trader intended for use in simulation studies of the dynamics\nof continuous double auction markets. Like Gode & Sunder's classic ZIC trader,\nPRZI generates quote-prices from a random distribution over some specified\ndomain of allowable quote-prices. Unlike ZIC, which uses a uniform distribution\nto generate prices, the probability distribution in a PRZI trader is\nparameterised in such a way that its probability mass function (PMF) is\ndetermined by a real-valued control variable s in the range [-1.0, +1.0] that\ndetermines the _strategy_ for that trader. When s=0, a PRZI trader is identical\nto ZIC, with a uniform PMF; but when |s|=~1 the PRZI trader's PMF becomes\nmaximally skewed to one extreme or the other of the price-range, thereby making\nits quote-prices more or less urgent, biasing the quote-price distribution\ntoward or away from the trader's limit-price. To explore the co-evolutionary\ndynamics of populations of PRZI traders that dynamically adapt their\nstrategies, I show results from long-term market experiments in which each\ntrader uses a simple stochastic hill-climber algorithm to repeatedly evaluate\nalternative s-values and choose the most profitable at any given time. In these\nexperiments the profitability of any particular s-value may be non-stationary\nbecause the profitability of one trader's strategy at any one time can depend\non the mix of strategies being played by the other traders at that time, which\nare each themselves continuously adapting. Results from these market\nexperiments demonstrate that the population of traders' strategies can exhibit\nrich dynamics, with periods of stability lasting over hundreds of thousands of\ntrader interactions interspersed by occasional periods of change. Python\nsource-code for the work reported here has been made publicly available on\nGitHub.",

In the former case, we provide a formal proof that Gradient\nAscent (GA) can be Li-Yorke chaotic for a step size as small as $\\Theta(1/n)$,\nwhere $n$ is the number of firms. In stark contrast, for the Fisher market\ncase, we derive a Proportional Response (PR) protocol that converges to market\nequilibrium. The positive results on the convergence of the PR dynamics are\nobtained in full generality, in the sense that they hold for Fisher markets\nwith \\emph{any} quasi-linear utility functions. Conversely, the chaos results\nfor the GA dynamics are established even in the simplest possible setting of\ntwo firms and one good, and they hold for a wide range of price functions with\ndifferent demand elasticities.

Finally, we present simple dynamic\nsimulations that considers how the retailer's optimal strategy changes as\nconsumers' subjective probability of believing the product is in stock\ndecreases. The results show that the retailer should offer BOPS in later\nperiods of the selling season to maximize its profit as the subjective\nprobability decreases.",

In a second part, we study the problem of a principal who\ncan choose how to distribute a reward budget over the ranks and aims to\nmaximize the performance of the median player. The optimal reward design\n(contract) is found in closed form, complementing the merely partial results\navailable in the $n$-player case. We then analyze the quality of the mean field\ndesign when used as a proxy for the optimizer in the $n$-player game.\nSurprisingly, the quality deteriorates dramatically as $n$ grows.

Moreover, we show that posting a single price in the single-buyer\ncase is in fact optimal under the assumption that either (1) the participation\ncost is independent of the value, and the value distribution has decreasing\nmarginal revenue or monotone hazard rate; or (2) the participation cost is a\nconcave function of the value.

        "abstract": "A fundamental assumption in classical mechanism design is that buyers are\nperfect optimizers. However, in practice, buyers may be limited by their\ncomputational capabilities or a lack of information, and may not be able to\nperfectly optimize. This has motivated the introduction of approximate\nincentive compatibility (IC) as an appealing solution concept for practical\nmechanism design. While most of the literature focuses on the analysis of\nparticular approximate IC mechanisms, this paper is the first to study the\ndesign of optimal mechanisms in the space of approximate IC mechanisms and to\nexplore how much revenue can be garnered by moving from exact to approximate\nincentive constraints. We study the problem of a seller facing one buyer with\nprivate values and analyze optimal selling mechanisms under\n$\\varepsilon$-incentive compatibility. We establish that the gains that can be\ngarnered depend on the local curvature of the seller's revenue function around\nthe optimal posted price when the buyer is a perfect optimizer. If the revenue\nfunction behaves locally like an $\\alpha$-power for $\\alpha \\in (1,\\infty)$,\nthen no mechanism can garner gains higher than order\n$\\varepsilon^{\\alpha/(2\\alpha-1)}$. This improves upon state-of-the-art results\nwhich imply maximum gains of $\\varepsilon^{1/2}$ by providing the first\nparametric bounds that capture the impact of revenue function's curvature on\nrevenue gains. Furthermore, we establish that an optimal mechanism needs to\nrandomize as soon as $\\varepsilon>0$ and construct a randomized mechanism that\nis guaranteed to achieve order $\\varepsilon^{\\alpha/(2\\alpha-1)}$ additional\nrevenues, leading to a tight characterization of the revenue implications of\napproximate IC constraints. Our work brings forward the need to optimize not\nonly over allocations and payments but also over best responses, and we develop\na new framework to address this challenge.",

In a general model of sequential learning over social\nnetworks, we identify a simple condition for learning dubbed excludability.\nExcludability is a joint property of agents' preferences and their information.\nWe develop two classes of preferences and information that jointly satisfy\nexcludability: (i) for a one-dimensional state, preferences with\nsingle-crossing differences and a new informational condition, directionally\nunbounded beliefs; and (ii) for a multi-dimensional state, intermediate\npreferences and subexponential location-shift information. These applications\nexemplify that with multiple states \"unbounded beliefs\" is not only unnecessary\nfor learning, but incompatible with familiar informational structures like\nnormal information. Unbounded beliefs demands that a single agent can identify\nthe correct action. Excludability, on the other hand, only requires that a\nsingle agent must be able to displace any wrong action, even if she cannot take\nthe correct action.",

We examine more closely the effects of distancing on the outset, the\npeak and the final size of the epidemic. First, we define a behavioral basic\nreproduction number and show that it is concave in the transmission rate. The\ninfection, therefore, spreads only if the transmission rate is in the\nintermediate region. Second, the peak of the epidemic is non-monotonic in the\ntransmission rate. A reduction in the transmission rate can lead to an increase\nof the peak. On the other hand, a decrease in the cost of distancing always\nflattens the curve. Third, both an increase in the infection rate as well as an\nincrease in the cost of distancing increase the size of the epidemic. Our\nresults have important implications on the modeling of interventions. Imposing\nrestrictions on the infection rate has qualitatively different effects on the\ntrajectory of the epidemics than imposing assumptions on the cost of\ndistancing. The interventions that affect interactions rather than the\ntransmission rate should, therefore, be modeled as changes in the cost of\ndistancing.",

In this work, we compare two analytical methods,\ni.e., Darwinian evolution and Nash equilibrium mapping, with a numerical\nagent-based approach. For completeness, we also give results for another\nanalytical method, Hamiltonian dynamics. In contrast to Hamiltonian dynamics,\nwhich involves the maximization of payoffs of all individuals, in Darwinian\nevolution, the payoff of a single player is maximized with respect to its\ninteraction with the nearest neighbor. While the Hamiltonian dynamics method\nutterly fails as compared to Nash equilibrium mapping, the Darwinian evolution\nmethod gives a false positive for game magnetization -- the net difference\nbetween the fraction of cooperators and defectors -- when payoffs obey the\ncondition a + d = b + c, wherein a,d represents the diagonal elements and b,c\nthe off-diagonal elements in a symmetric social dilemma game payoff matrix.\nWhen either a + d =/= b + c or when one looks at the average payoff per player,\nthe Darwinian evolution method fails, much like the Hamiltonian dynamics\napproach. On the other hand, the Nash equilibrium mapping and numerical\nagent-based method agree well for both game magnetization and average payoff\nper player for the social dilemmas in question, i.e., the Hawk-Dove game and\nthe Public goods game.

A complete characterization of\noptimal interventions is obtained by decomposing interventions into principal\ncomponents of the network's adjacency matrix. Welfare is most sensitive to\ninterventions proportional to the last principal component, which focus on\nlocal disagreement. A welfare-maximizing planner optimally works to reduce\nlocal disagreement, bringing the ideal points of neighbors closer together,\nwhereas a malevolent adversary optimally drives neighbors' ideal points apart\nto decrease welfare. Such welfare-maximizing/minimizing interventions are very\ndifferent from ones that would be done to change some traditional measures of\ndiscord, such as the cross-sectional variation of equilibrium actions. In fact,\nan adversary sowing disagreement to maximize her impact on welfare will\nminimize her impact on global variation in equilibrium actions, underscoring a\ntension between improving welfare and increasing global cohesion of equilibrium\nbehavior.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a new algorithm for finding stable matchings in multi-sided\nmatching markets. Our setting is motivated by a PhD market of students,\nadvisors, and co-advisors, and can be generalized to supply chain networks\nviewed as $n$-sided markets. In the three-sided PhD market, students primarily\ncare about advisors and then about co-advisors (consistent preferences), while\nadvisors and co-advisors have preferences over students only (hence they are\ncooperative). A student must be matched to one advisor and one co-advisor, or\nnot at all. In contrast to previous work, advisor-student and\nstudent-co-advisor pairs may not be mutually acceptable (e.g., a student may\nnot want to work with an advisor or co-advisor and vice versa). We show that\nthree-sided stable matchings always exist, and present an algorithm that, in\ntime quadratic in the market size (up to log factors), finds a three-sided\nstable matching using any two-sided stable matching algorithm as matching\nengine. We illustrate the challenges that arise when not all advisor-co-advisor\npairs are compatible. We then generalize our algorithm to $n$-sided markets\nwith quotas and show how they can model supply chain networks. Finally, we show\nhow our algorithm outperforms the baseline given by [Danilov, 2003] in terms of\nboth producing a stable matching and a larger number of matches on a synthetic\ndataset.",

An important and ubiquitous feature of these\nauctions is the presence of campaign budgets, which specify the maximum amount\nthe advertisers are willing to pay over a specified time period. In this paper,\nwe present a new model to study the equilibrium bidding strategies in standard\nauctions, a large class of auctions that includes first- and second-price\nauctions, for advertisers who satisfy budget constraints on average. Our model\ndispenses with the common, yet unrealistic assumption that advertisers' values\nare independent and instead assumes a contextual model in which advertisers\ndetermine their values using a common feature vector. We show the existence of\na natural value-pacing-based Bayes-Nash equilibrium under very mild\nassumptions. Furthermore, we prove a revenue equivalence showing that all\nstandard auctions yield the same revenue even in the presence of budget\nconstraints. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove Price of Anarchy bounds for\nliquid welfare and structural properties of pacing-based equilibria that hold\nfor all standard auctions. In recent years, the internet advertising market has\nadopted first-price auctions as the preferred paradigm for selling advertising\nslots. Our work thus takes an important step toward understanding the\nimplications of the shift to first-price auctions in internet advertising\nmarkets by studying how the choice of the selling mechanism impacts revenues,\nwelfare, and advertisers' bidding strategies.",

The sender seeks to persuade the receivers into\ntaking actions aligned with the sender's preference by selectively sharing\nstate information. However, in contrast to the standard models, neither the\nsender nor the receivers know the distribution, and the sender has to persuade\nwhile learning the distribution on the fly.\n  We study the sender's learning problem of making persuasive action\nrecommendations to achieve low regret against the optimal persuasion mechanism\nwith the knowledge of the distribution.

The expansion is measured as the\nKullblack-Leibler divergence between posterior decisions and prior beliefs.\nWhen information acquisition is free, the homo economicus agent is recovered,\nwhile in cases when information acquisition becomes costly, agents instead\nrevert to their prior beliefs. The maximum entropy principle is used to infer\nleast-biased decisions based upon the notion of Smithian competition formalised\nwithin the Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium framework. The\nincorporation of prior beliefs into such a framework allowed us to\nsystematically explore the effects of prior beliefs on decision-making in the\npresence of market feedback, as well as importantly adding a temporal\ninterpretation to the framework. We verified the proposed model using\nAustralian housing market data, showing how the incorporation of prior\nknowledge alters the resulting agent decisions.

This\nimpossibility result fostered an intense investigation of meaningful trade-offs\nbetween these desired properties. Much work has focused on approximately\nefficient fixed-price mechanisms, i.e., Blumrosen and Dobzinski (2014; 2016),\nColini-Baldeschi et al.

        "abstract": "We study a game theoretic model of standardized testing for college\nadmissions. Students are of two types; High and Low. There is a college that\nwould like to admit the High type students. Students take a potentially costly\nstandardized exam which provides a noisy signal of their type.\n  The students come from two populations, which are identical in talent (i.e.\nthe type distribution is the same), but differ in their access to resources:\nthe higher resourced population can at their option take the exam multiple\ntimes, whereas the lower resourced population can only take the exam once. We\nstudy two models of score reporting, which capture existing policies used by\ncolleges. The first policy (sometimes known as \"super-scoring\") allows students\nto report the max of the scores they achieve. The other policy requires that\nall scores be reported.\n  We find in our model that requiring that all scores be reported results in\nsuperior outcomes in equilibrium, both from the perspective of the college (the\nadmissions rule is more accurate), and from the perspective of equity across\npopulations: a student's probability of admission is independent of their\npopulation, conditional on their type. In particular, the false positive rates\nand false negative rates are identical in this setting, across the highly and\npoorly resourced student populations. This is the case despite the fact that\nthe more highly resourced students can -- at their option -- either report a\nmore accurate signal of their type, or pool with the lower resourced population\nunder this policy.",

We\nmodel the problem as an approval-based multiwinner election where the set of\ncandidates consists of all possible matchings and agents' preferences over each\nother are lifted to preferences over matchings. Due to the exponential number\nof candidates in such elections, standard algorithms for classical sequential\nvoting rules (such as those proposed by Thiele and Phragm\\'en) are rendered\ninefficient. We show that the computational tractability of these rules can be\nregained by exploiting the structure of the approval preferences. Moreover, we\nestablish algorithmic results and axiomatic guarantees that go beyond those\nobtainable in the general multiwinner setting. Assuming that approvals are\nsymmetric, we show that proportional approval voting (PAV), a well-established\nbut computationally intractable voting rule, becomes polynomial-time\ncomputable, and its sequential variant (seq-PAV), which does not provide any\nproportionality guarantees in general, fulfills a rather strong guarantee known\nas extended justified representation.

Second, when\none source represents background risk, we can accommodate Rabin (2000)'s\ncritique and explain risk aversion over small gambles. Finally, when different\nsources represent consumptions in different periods, we unify three seemingly\ndistinct models of time preferences and propose a novel model that\nsimultaneously satisfies indifference to temporal resolution of uncertainty,\nseparation of time and risk preferences, and recursivity in the domain of\nlotteries.

If it does, it must satisfy the\nmixture continuity axiom of Herstein and Milnor (1953). Mixture continuity is\nsufficient for a mixture-preserving multi-representation when the dimension of\nthe mixture space is countable, but not when it is uncountable. Our strongest\npositive result is that mixture continuity is sufficient in conjunction with a\nnovel axiom we call countable domination, which constrains the order complexity\nof the mixture preorder in terms of its Archimedean structure. We also consider\nwhat happens when the mixture space is given its natural weak topology.\nContinuity (having closed upper and lower sets) and closedness (having a closed\ngraph) are stronger than mixture continuity. We show that continuity is\nnecessary but not sufficient for a mixture preorder to have a\nmixture-preserving multi-representation. Closedness is also necessary; we leave\nit as an open question whether it is sufficient.

Airlines,\nfor example, offer fares with severe restrictions rather than making them\nunavailable. This is a more subtle way of handling the trade-off between demand\ninduction and demand cannibalization. For the latent class MNL model, a firm\nthat engages in refined assortment optimization can make up to $\\min(n,m)$\ntimes more than one that insists on traditional assortment optimization, where\n$n$ is the number of products and $m$ the number of customer types.\nSurprisingly, the revenue-ordered assortment heuristic has the same performance\nguarantees relative to {\\em personalized} refined assortment optimization as it\ndoes to traditional assortment optimization. Based on this finding, we\nconstruct refinements of the revenue-order heuristic and measure their improved\nperformance relative to the revenue-ordered assortment and the optimal\ntraditional assortment optimization problem. We also provide tight bounds on\nthe ratio of the expected revenues for the refined versus the traditional\nassortment optimization for some well known discrete choice models.",

Using a factor\nvector with equal components results in uniform pricing and has exceedingly\nmild sufficient conditions for the bound to hold.

The\nGibbard-Satterthwaite theorem has shown that only extremely restrictive SCFs\nare strategyproof when there are more than two alternatives. For set-valued\nSCFs, or so-called social choice correspondences, the situation is less clear.\nThere are miscellaneous - mostly negative - results using a variety of\nstrategyproofness notions and additional requirements. The simple and intuitive\nnotion of Kelly-strategyproofness has turned out to be particularly compelling\nbecause it is weak enough to still allow for positive results. For example, the\nPareto rule is strategyproof even when preferences are weak, and a number of\nattractive SCFs (such as the top cycle, the uncovered set, and the essential\nset) are strategyproof for strict preferences. In this paper, we show that, for\nweak preferences, only indecisive SCFs can satisfy strategyproofness. In\nparticular, (i) every strategyproof rank-based SCF violates Pareto-optimality,\n(ii) every strategyproof support-based SCF (which generalize Fishburn's C2\nSCFs) that satisfies Pareto-optimality returns at least one most preferred\nalternative of every voter, and (iii) every strategyproof non-imposing SCF\nreturns the Condorcet loser in at least one profile.

The\nalgorithm returns a stable matching in the sense that no unmatched persons\nprefer to be matched together rather than with their current partners (given\ntheir indicated preferences). Roth [1984] gives evidence that only stable\nmatchings are likely to be adhered to over time. Additionally, the matching is\nstudent-optimal.

To optimally\nscreen the agents, the designer first asks agents to report their types and\nthen sends a private action recommendation to each agent whose distribution\ndepends on all reported types and the state. We show that there always exists\nan optimal mechanism which is laminar partitional. Such a mechanism partitions\nthe state space for each type profile and recommends the same action profile\nfor states that belong to the same partition element. Furthermore, the convex\nhulls of any two partition elements are such that either one contains the other\nor they have an empty intersection. In the single-agent case, each state is\neither perfectly revealed or lies in an interval in which the number of\ndifferent signal realizations is at most the number of different types of the\nagent plus two. A similar result is established for the multi-agent case.\n  We also highlight the value of screening: without screening the best\nachievable payoff could be as low as one over the number of types fraction of\nthe optimal payoff. Along the way, we shed light on the solutions of\noptimization problems over distributions subject to a mean-preserving\ncontraction constraint and additional side constraints, which might be of\nindependent interest.",

Confronting and addressing the issues concerning the scarce\nresource's conservation, competition, and stimulation by grappling its\ncharacteristics and adopting viable policy instruments calls the\ndecision-maker's attention with a paramount priority. In this paper, we develop\nthe first general decentralized cross-sector supply chain network model that\ncaptures the unique features of scarce resources under a unifying fiscal policy\nscheme.

We then characterize the\nnetwork equilibrium with a set of classic theoretical properties, as well as\nwith a set of properties that are novel to the network games application\nliterature, namely, the lowest eigenvalue of the game Jacobian. Lastly, we\nprovide a series of illustrative examples, including a medical glove supply\nnetwork, to showcase how our model can be used to investigate the efficacy of\nthe imposed policies in relieving supply chain distress and stimulating\nwelfare. Our managerial insights inform and expand the political dialogues on\nfiscal policy design, public resource legislation, social welfare\nredistribution, and supply chain practice toward sustainability.",

This bound is best possible, since it is\nthe integrality gap of the natural underlying LP. Our profit allocation method\ngoes further: the multiplier on the profit of an agent is often better than ${2\n\\over 3}$ and lies in the interval $[{2 \\over 3}, 1]$, depending on how\nseverely constrained the agent is.\n  Next, we provide new insights showing how discerning core imputations of an\nassignment games are by studying them via the lens of complementary slackness.\nWe present a relationship between the competitiveness of individuals and teams\nof agents and the amount of profit they accrue in imputations that lie in the\ncore, where by {\\em competitiveness} we mean whether an individual or a team is\nmatched in every/some/no maximum matching. This also sheds light on the\nphenomenon of degeneracy in assignment games, i.e., when the maximum weight\nmatching is not unique.\n  The core is a quintessential solution concept in cooperative game theory. It\ncontains all ways of distributing the total worth of a game among agents in\nsuch a way that no sub-coalition has incentive to secede from the grand\ncoalition.

In particular, we study the communication\nrequirements of a protocol which: (a) implements $f$, (b) implements $f$ and\ncomputes payments that make it ex-post incentive compatible (EPIC) to follow\nthe protocol, and (c) implements $f$ and computes payments in a way that makes\nit dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) to follow the protocol.\n  We show exponential separations between all three of these quantities,\nalready for just two players. That is, we first construct an $f$ such that $f$\ncan be implemented in communication $c$, but any EPIC implementation of $f$\n(with any choice of payments) requires communication $\\exp(c)$. This answers an\nopen question of [FS09, BBS13]. Second, we construct an $f$ such that an EPIC\nprotocol implements $f$ with communication $C$, but all DSIC implementations of\n$f$ require communication $\\exp(C)$.",

A novelty\nof our games is that their utility is given by information leakage, which in\nsome cases may behave in a non-linear way. This causes a significant deviation\nfrom classic game theory, in which utility functions are linear with respect to\nplayers' strategies. Hence, a key contribution of this paper is the\nestablishment of the foundations of information leakage games. We consider two\nkinds of games, depending on the notion of leakage considered. The first kind,\nthe QIF-games, is tailored for the theory of quantitative information flow\n(QIF). The second one, the DP-games, corresponds to differential privacy (DP).",

We start by modifying the MAB framework to\nfit the setting of the repeated consumer search model and formulate the\nobjective as a dynamic optimization problem. Then, given any sequence of\nexploration, we assign a value to each store in that sequence using Bellman\nequations. We then proceed to break down the problem into individual optimal\nstopping problems for each period which incidentally coincides with the\nframework of the famous secretary problem where we proceed to derive the\noptimal stopping policy.

        "abstract": "How to guarantee that firms perform due diligence before launching\npotentially dangerous products? We study the design of liability rules when (i)\nlimited liability prevents firms from internalizing the full damage they may\ncause, (ii) penalties are paid only if damage occurs, regardless of the\nproduct's inherent riskiness, (iii) firms have private information about their\nproducts' riskiness before performing due diligence. We show that (i) any\nliability mechanism can be implemented by a tariff that depends only on the\nevidence acquired by the firm if a damage occurs, not on any initial report by\nthe firm about its private information, (ii) firms that assign a higher prior\nto product riskiness always perform more due diligence but less than is\nsocially optimal, and (iii) under a simple and intuitive condition, any\ntype-specific launch thresholds can be implemented by a monotonic tariff.",

        "abstract": "This is an expanded version of the lecture given at the AMS Short Course on\nMean Field Games, on January 13, 2020 in Denver CO. The assignment was to\ndiscuss applications of Mean Field Games in finance and economics. I need to\nadmit upfront that several of the examples reviewed in this chapter were\nalready discussed in book form. Still, they are here accompanied with\ndiscussions of, and references to, works which appeared over the last three\nyears. Moreover, several completely new sections are added to show how recent\ndevelopments in financial engineering and economics can benefit from being\nviewed through the lens of the Mean Field Game paradigm. The new financial\nengineering applications deal with bitcoin mining and the energy markets, while\nthe new economic applications concern models offering a smooth transition\nbetween macro-economics and finance, and contract theory.",

        "title": "How Covid-19 Pandemic Changes the Theory of Economics?",
        "abstract": "During its history, the ultimate goal of economics has been to develop\nsimilar frameworks for modeling economic behavior as invented in physics. This\nhas not been successful, however, and current state of the process is the\nneoclassical framework that bases on static optimization. By using a static\nframework, however, we cannot model and forecast the time paths of economic\nquantities because for a growing firm or a firm going into bankruptcy, a\npositive profit maximizing flow of production does not exist. Due to these\nproblems, we present a dynamic theory for the production of a profit-seeking\nfirm where the adjustment may be stable or unstable. This is important,\ncurrently, because we should be able to forecast the possible future\nbankruptcies of firms due to the Covid-19 pandemic. By using the model, we can\nsolve the time moment of bankruptcy of a firm as a function of several\nparameters. The proposed model is mathematically identical with Newtonian model\nof a particle moving in a resisting medium, and so the model explains the\nreasons that stop the motion too. The frameworks for modeling dynamic events in\nphysics are thus applicable in economics, and we give reasons why physics is\nmore important for the development of economics than pure mathematics.

        "abstract": "We propose a model of labor market sector self-selection that combines\ncomparative advantage, as in the Roy model, and sector composition preference.\nTwo groups choose between two sectors based on heterogeneous potential incomes\nand group compositions in each sector. Potential incomes incorporate group\nspecific human capital accumulation and wage discrimination. Composition\npreferences are interpreted as reflecting group specific amenity preferences as\nwell as homophily and aversion to minority status. We show that occupational\nsegregation is amplified by the composition preferences and we highlight a\nresulting tension between redistribution and diversity. The model also exhibits\ntipping from extreme compositions to more balanced ones. Tipping occurs when a\nsmall nudge, associated with affirmative action, pushes the system to a very\ndifferent equilibrium, and when the set of equilibria changes abruptly when a\nparameter governing the relative importance of pecuniary and composition\npreferences crosses a threshold.",
