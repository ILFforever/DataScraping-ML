    "abstract": "We give an elementary proof that the $H^p$ spaces over the unit disc (or the\nupper half plane) are the interpolation spaces for the real method of\ninterpolation between $H^1$ and $H^\\infty$. This was originally proved by Peter\nJones. The proof uses only the boundedness of the Hilbert transform and the\nclassical factorisation of a function in $H^p$ as a product of two functions in\n$H^q$ and $H^r$ with $1/q+1/r=1/p$. This proof extends without any real extra\ndifficulty to the non-commutative setting and to several Banach space valued\nextensions of $H^p$ spaces. In particular, this proof easily extends to the\ncouple $H^{p_0}(\\ell_{q_0}),H^{p_1}(\\ell_{q_1})$, with $1\\leq p_0, p_1, q_0,\nq_1 \\leq \\infty$. In that situation, we prove that the real interpolation\nspaces and the K-functional are induced ( up to equivalence of norms ) by the\nsame objects for the couple $L_{p_0}(\\ell_{q_0}), L_{p_1}(\\ell_{q_1})$. In\nanother direction, let us denote by $C_p$ the space of all compact operators\n$x$ on Hilbert space such that $tr(|x|^p) <\\infty$. Let $T_p$ be the subspace\nof all upper triangular matrices relative to the canonical basis. If\n$p=\\infty$, $C_p$ is just the space of all compact operators. Our proof allows\nus to show for instance that the space $H^p(C_p)$ (resp. $T_p$) is the\ninterpolation space of parameter $(1/p,p)$ between $H^1(C_1)$ (resp. $T_1$) and\n$H^\\infty(C_\\infty)$ (resp. $T_\\i$). We also prove a similar result for the\ncomplex interpolation method. Moreover, extending a recent result of\nKaftal-Larson and Weiss, we prove that the distance to the subspace of upper\ntriangular matrices in $C_1$ and $C_\\infty$ can be essentially realized\nsimultaneously by the same element.",

    "abstract": "Building on a recent work of \\v C. Crnkovi\\'c, M. Douglas and G. Moore, a\nstudy of multi-critical multi-cut one-matrix models and their associated\n$sl(2,C)$ integrable hierarchies, is further pursued. The double scaling limits\nof hermitian matrix models with different scaling ans\\\"atze, lead, to the KdV\nhierarchy, to the modified KdV hierarchy and part of the non-linear\nSchr\\\"odinger hierarchy. Instead, the anti-hermitian matrix model, in the\ntwo-arc sector, results in the Zakharov-Shabat hierarchy, which contains both\nKdV and mKdV as reductions. For all the hierarchies, it is found that the\nVirasoro constraints act on the associated tau-functions. Whereas it is known\nthat the ZS and KdV models lead to the Virasoro constraints of an $sl(2,C)$\nvacuum, we find that the mKdV model leads to the Virasoro constraints of a\nhighest weight state with arbitrary conformal dimension.",

The singlet sector of the $c=1$ matrix model\ncorresponds to a specific external gauge field. The gauge theory is\none-dimensional (time) and the space coordinate is treated as a group index.\nThe generators of the gauge algebra are polynomials in the single particle\nmomentum and position operators and they form the group $W^{(+)}_{1+\\infty}$.\nThere are corresponding Ward identities and residual gauge transformations that\nleave the external gauge fields invariant. We discuss the realization of these\nresidual symmetries in the Minkowski time theory and conclude that the\nsymmetries generated by the polynomial basis are not realized. We motivate and\npresent an analytic continuation of the model which realises the group of\nresidual symmetries. We consider the classical limit of this theory and make\nthe correspondence with the discrete states of the $c=1$ (Euclidean time)\nLiouville theory. We explain the appearance of the $SL(2)$ structure in\n$W^{(+)}_{1+\\infty}$. We also present all the Euclidean classical solutions and\nthe classical action in the classical phase space.

A prominent role is played by the modular weights of the massless\nfields. We present a general classification of all possible modular weights of\nmassless fields in Abelian orbifolds. We show that the cancellation of modular\nanomalies strongly constrains the massless fermion content of the theory, in\nclose analogy with the standard ABJ anomalies. We emphasize the validity of\nthis approach not only for (2,2) orbifolds but for (0,2) models with and\nwithout Wilson lines. As an application one can show that one cannot build a\n${\\bf Z}_3$ or ${\\bf Z}_7$ orbifold whose massless charged sector with respect\nto the (level one) gauge group $SU(3)\\times SU(2) \\times U(1)$ is that of the\nminimal supersymmetric standard model, since any such model would necessarily\nhave duality anomalies. A general study of those constraints for Abelian\norbifolds is presented. Duality anomalies are also related to the computation\nof string threshold corrections to gauge coupling constants. We present an\nanalysis of the possible relevance of those threshold corrections to the\ncomputation of $\\sin^2\\theta_W$ and $\\alpha_3$ for all Abelian orbifolds. Some\nparticular {\\it minimal} scenarios, namely those based on all ${\\bf Z}_N$\norbifolds except ${\\bf Z}_6$",

    "abstract": "We consider superstring compactifications where both the classical\ndescription, in terms of a Calabi-Yau manifold, and also the quantum theory is\nknown in terms of a Landau-Ginzburg orbifold model. In particular, we study\n(smooth) Calabi-Yau examples in which there are obstructions to parametrizing\nall of the complex structure cohomology by polynomial deformations thus\nrequiring the analysis based on exact and spectral sequences. General arguments\nensure that the Landau-Ginzburg chiral ring copes with such a situation by\nhaving a nontrivial contribution from twisted sectors. Beyond the expected\nfinal agreement between the mathematical and physical approaches, we find a\ndirect correspondence between the analysis of each, thus giving a more complete\nmathematical understanding of twisted sectors. Furthermore, this approach shows\nthat physical reasoning based upon spectral flow arguments for determining the\nspectrum of Landau-Ginzburg orbifold models finds direct mathematical\njustification in Koszul complex calculations and also that careful point- field\nanalysis continues to recover suprisingly much of the stringy features.",

We explicitly construct new minimal\narea metrics that do not arise from quadratic differentials.\n  Under the physically motivated assumption of existence of the minimal area\nmetrics, we show there exist neighborhoods of the punctures isometric to a flat\nsemiinfinite cylinder of circumference $2\\pi$, allowing the definition of\ncanonical complex coordinates around the punctures. The plumbing of surfaces\nwith minimal area metrics is shown to induce a metric of minimal area on the\nresulting surface.

This rather disturbing state of\naffairs has led Hawking to formulate his Chronology Protection Conjecture,\nwhereby the formation of ``time machines'' is forbidden. This paper will use\nseveral simple examples to argue that the universe appears to exhibit a\n``defense in depth'' strategy in this regard. For appropriate parameter regimes\nCasimir effects, wormhole disruption effects, and gravitational back reaction\neffects all contribute to the fight against time travel. Particular attention\nis paid to the role of the quantum gravity cutoff. For the class of model\nproblems considered it is shown that the gravitational back reaction becomes\nlarge before the Planck scale quantum gravity cutoff is reached, thus\nsupporting Hawking's conjecture.",
